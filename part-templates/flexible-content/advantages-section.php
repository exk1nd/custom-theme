		<p class="advantages-list-content-description">When you’re facing a financial hardship and need cash fast, loans
			with no credit check can be appealing. But they don’t come without a few drawbacks.</p>

		<p class="advantages-list-content-description"><i>Poor credit loans pros:</i></p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Fast and easy application process.</strong> Most loan requests are available online, so
				applying and qualifying may only take a few minutes or a few hours. Not to mention that your
				money can be deposited in your bank account within one day.
			</li>
			<li><strong>You have options.</strong> With a no credit check loan, it pays to shop around to find a
				lender that will work with you. You might even find a lender that will offer you an affordable
				interest rate or better terms, or customer service.
			</li>
			<li><strong>A range of repayment periods.</strong> The repayment period depends a great deal on the
				lender you choose to work with. Payday loans may have a term of a few weeks or until your next
				payday, while others have terms that range from several months to five years.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Improve your credit score.</strong> If you have poor or bad credit, one way to
				improve your score (which will make it easier to eligibility requirements in the future) is to make all of
				your
				payments on time. The last thing you want is a cycle of bad debt.
			</li>
		</ul>

			<p><b>After all, the <a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/IN11059.pdf" target="_blanck">Consumer
						Financial Protection Bureau</a> estimates that almost 80% of American consumers roll
					over their unsecured payday loans.</b></p></blockquote>
		<p></p>


		<p><i>Bad credit loans cons:</i></p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>High interest rates.</strong> Lenders bear increased responsibility while issuing no credit check
				loans for people with poor credit histories.
				To offset that risk, they often charge very high-interest rates on these loans. APRs can
				range from 5.99% up to 199%.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Origination fees.</strong> Not all loans with no credit check have fees attached, but most do. It
				pays to read the small print on your loan approval. Some fees, like processing, origination, and
				late fees for non payments can really add up and increase the amount you have to pay back.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Unauthorized or fraudulent lenders.</strong> Not all lenders are licensed or certified
				in all states. That’s another reason why it’s so important to learn the state laws and shop around for a
				lender that can
				work with you in your location. The FDIC also recommends that you should check to be sure you’re
				not working with a fraudulent lender who is trying to mislead you into transferring money or
				disclosing your personal information.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Secured or unsecured by collateral.</strong> Some no credit check loans require collateral. That
				may mean you have to put up your home or car as a guarantee you’ll
				repay your debt. (If you apply for car title or home loans) Remember, if you miss payments or default on
				your loan, they can take your
				collateral or foreclose on your home.

				<a><h4 itemprop="name">What does guaranteed credit approval mean?</h4></a>
				<div class="conte" itemscope="" itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
					<p itemprop="text">Guaranteed credit approval does not necessarily mean that a lender
						approves everyone or that a lender will automatically approve you for a loan. What it
						does mean is that some lenders are willing to work with you even if your credit score is
						between 300 and 650. That means if you have bad credit (or no credit), you likely won’t
						be turned away.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="accordion-item" itemscope="" itemprop="mainEntity"
			     itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
				<a><h4 itemprop="name">What does a guaranteed loan mean?</h4></a>
				<div class="conte" itemscope="" itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
					<p itemprop="text">A guaranteed loan is paid by a third party if you default on the amount
						you borrowed. If you have bad credit but need a cash advance, this assures lenders that
						they won’t lose money if you can’t pay it back. A payday loan is guaranteed, as it is
						secured by your paycheck.</p>

				<a><h4 itemprop="name">Is it possible to get a $5000 loan with bad credit?</h4></a>
				<div class="conte" itemscope="" itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
					<p itemprop="text">Yes. It is possible, even if you have poor credit. But, more often than
						not you will be limited to installment loans for bad credit, which are typically paid
						back over three to 18 months. You can apply online and have your funds deposited in your
						bank as fast as the same day. But, you’ll likely pay high-interest rates.</p>

				<a><h4 itemprop="name">Are there any guaranteed loans for bad credit?</h4></a>
				<div class="conte" itemscope="" itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
					<div itemprop="text">
						<p>Few things in life are guaranteed. Guaranteed loans are no different. Of course,
							there may be scammers who promise a guarantee or lenders who charge extremely high
							rates and fees for a lender’s services, but neither are trustworthy.</p>

						<p>Banks and credit unions will consider your credit score and credit history when
							offering a loan, but online direct lenders also look at employment history, your
							monthly income, your payments history and the amount of debt you currently owe.</p>
