                    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to buy tickets to any significant sports game, you
                        should be ready to pay the price which can be quite high sometimes. More likely you will face a
                        need of paying extra if your decision to buy tickets was impulsive. Though, don’t get despaired,
                        because it is always some way out.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">First of all, there is an opportunity to <a href="/">get
                            money online</a> and also PayDaySay gathered information about 7 great places where you can
                        buy cheap sports tickets. So, you still have a chance to visit big games without breaking the
                        bank! Check all the available options to purchase the tickets and pay attention to such
                        important factors like cost, availability and seats’ location.</p>
                    <p><span id="more-1683"></span></p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Physical Box Office</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">One of the simplest choices is <strong>visiting the team’s box
                            office and buying tickets in person</strong>. Of course, buying online is more convenient
                        but when you buy directly from the box office, you can be 100% confident that you don’t pay more
                        than tickets really cost. Also, this option is good if you have to buy tickets for a family or a
                        big company because then the tickets seller can give you advice concerning comfortable seat
                        options.</p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Sellers</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">There are always people selling tickets. And here are <strong>2
                            basic categories</strong>: the ones who need to sell their tickets urgently by any reason
                        and those who do it professionally and want to get as much money from you as possible. Look for
                        representatives of the 1<sup>st</sup> category: when someone is desperate you can always ask for
                        a discount and try to make the deal on your conditions. Always beware of scam: today technology
                        allows printing tickets at home so check if the stadium has an official secondary sales area.
                    </p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Craigslist</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re looking for a perfect place to purchase tickets online
                        then <strong>Craigslist is one of your top options</strong>. You buy tickets directly from other
                        individuals and quite often they charge less than the rest of retailers. If you buy through
                        Craigslist, act quickly and keep in mind that there are many other people looking for good deals
                        the same as you do. Beware of fraud and fake tickets because you never know who you are dealing
                        with.</p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">StubHub</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">If tickets are already sold out for the game you want to attend, you
                        can benefit with such a famous resource as <strong>StubHub</strong>. This company has a
                        reputation in online ticket sales, even if tickets aren’t sold out yet it’s still worth checking
                        this company for attractive deals. There you can meet people who want to resell their tickets
                        and enjoy well-organized StubHub’s system.</p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Ticketmaster</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">To be short, it’s the biggest name in the industry. That’s why you
                        can be sure that you’ll receive your order on time and if any problem will arise, it will be
                        solved by the company’s staff. There are <strong>a few ways you can access Ticketmaster</strong>:
                        on the Internet, by the phone or in retail stores. But keep in mind that tickets there can be
                        sold out very quickly and also you have to pay additional fees for the service. That’s why it
                        would be wise to think about the ways of saving money beforehand.</p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Vivid Seats</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">This company is not as popular as the ones mentioned above, but
                        still, you can benefit from their service. The website has a nice and convenient interface and
                        there’s friendly consumer support. The company’s staff will answer any questions concerning your
                        order but however, there’s a quite high service fee in the industry. That’s why it would be wise
                        to think about the ways of saving money beforehand.</p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">TicketsNow</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">This company provides a convenient and quality service as
                        Ticketmaster does, but <strong>mostly it focuses on secondary sales</strong>. However, you have
                        to pay a high service fee which is a significant drawback. You can take advantage of the
                        <strong>live chat</strong> and discuss pricing and delivery options with the company’s online
                        consultant.</p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion</h2>
