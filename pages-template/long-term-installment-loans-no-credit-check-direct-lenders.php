                        Lenders?</h1>

                    <p>Long-term installment loans are the same as traditional short-term installment loans but the
                        repayment period is longer – up to several years. Most of the loans carry interest but it’s
                        possible to find interest-free long-term installment loans. While you can qualify for bad credit
                        installment loans, with high interest and less profitable loan terms, <strong>no credit check
                            hardly exists</strong>. There is always at least a soft credit check.</p>

                    <p>The main use of these loans lies in consolidating credit card debt for a lower interest rate.
                        Installment loans have another benefit over credit cards. Even when you make a little payment,
                        you are gradually paying off the principle. When you do so with credit cards, the contribution
                        is very small, almost invisible.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <h3>If the company insists on performing no credit check, they either lie or try to trap you
                            into a bad deal.</h3>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Long-term installment loans online and from the local lending institutions usually offer lower
                        interest rates but the loan terms are stricter. Therefore, not every bank or credit union will
                        approve a loan request from the borrower with weak creditworthiness.</p>
                    <p>In such cases, borrowers often apply to long-term installment loans from direct lenders. These
                        entities deal with borrowers without mediators and don’t charge additional fees for extra work.
                        This is a sort of economy but if you are looking for no credit check long-term installment
                        loans, you should be ready to lose some money, you will get any luck. If the company insists on
                        performing no credit check, they either lie or try to trap you into a bad deal.</p>
