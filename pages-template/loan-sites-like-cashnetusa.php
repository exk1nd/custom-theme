                    <h3>SoLo Funds</h3>
                    <p>Want to get a short-term loan but don't want to pay high interest? SoLo Funds has a solution for you! This lender is worth considering if you need a small loan amount to solve unforeseen expenses. </p>
                    <p>Solo Funds allows you to borrow between $20 and $575. The loan term usually doesn't exceed 35 days.</p>
                    <p>This company's distinct feature is that it doesn't charge interest fees. Instead, borrowers can make voluntary donations to support the platform or tip the lender. </p>
                    <p>Note that SoLo Funds isn't a direct borrower. The funds will be issued to you by Synapse's partner banks, Members FDIC.</p>
                    <p>If you want to boost your score, SoLo Funds sends a credit report to the main credit bureaus. It means that by fulfilling your financial obligations on time, you can increase your chances of getting larger loans.</p>
                    <p>However, be aware of late payments, otherwise, you will be charged a 10% fee of the loan amount. The company also has an origination fee of 0.9% of the loan plus $0.70.</p>
                    <p>All in all, SoLo Funds is an excellent alternative to CashNetUsa if you want to save money on interest. But it is beneficial only for people who need less than $575.</p>

                    <h3>LendUp</h3>
                    <p>If you are looking for reliable payday loan sites, LendUp is among the ones to consider. With more than 10 years of experience, it provides a quick and easy application process even for people with poor credit. </p>
                    <p>There are two types of financial products available to customers: single payment and installment loans. The first option allows borrowers to get between $100 and $255 with a short repayment term ranging from 7 to 30 days and an APR of 214.13% - 917.71%.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, if you choose a LendUp installment loan, you can qualify for up to $1,000. To repay this sum, you may have from 1 to 6 months. For this loan type, you will pay the APRs ranging from 32.08% to 71.07%.</p>
                    <p>Since the interest charges are high, the LendUp services are prohibited by some state laws and are available in just 8 states: MS, MO, SC, CA, LA, TN, WI, and TX. </p>
                    <p>This payday lender doesn’t allow pre-qualification, but if approved, you can choose the payday by yourself. LendUp provides instant loan decisions and sends funds until the next business day.</p>
                    <p>If you need money instantly and have bad credit, this lender may become your helping hand. However, high interest charges and a lack of financial options may be a problem for you.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Rise Credit </h3>
                    <p>Rise Credit is another popular alternative to CashNetUsa. It offers loans online for various purposes, including debt consolidation and home repairs. For this lender poor credit is not a verdict. Everyone can get approved without a credit check and receive funds the same day.</p>
                    <p>The minimum loan amount is rather high - $300, while the maximum one amounts to $5,000. Like it is with other companies, APR depends on the state and may vary from 36% to 299%. This lender can boast of relatively appealing loan terms that are between four and 26 months.</p>
                    <p>You should remember that Rise Credit serves as an indirect lending platform and doesn’t borrow money itself. Your lender will be defined by your place of living. The funds can be provided to borrowers the next business day by FinWise Bank, CCBank, or state installment institutions.</p>
                    <p>If you opt for this lender, you will avoid prepayment and origination fees. What’s more, 5 days after taking a loan, you can change your mind and return the money without any charges.</p>
                    <p>Is Rise Credit good for you? The answer depends on your loan purpose. If you need a small cash advance instantly or want to boost your rating, this platform is worth considering. However, if you need less than $300 or more than $5,000, it is better to look for another option. </p>

                    <h3>ExtraLend</h3>
                    <p>ExtraLend is among the most popular payday loan sites that may be viewed as a CashNetUsa alternative. This indirect lending company serves as a mediator between borrowers and lenders. It lets you get various financial solutions.

                    <p>With more than 20 years on the market, this lender knows how easy the application process looks. The loan request form is simple and short. You only need a few minutes and any device with an Internet connection.</p>
                    <p>With ExtraLend, you can receive from $200 to $3,000 the same or the next business day. The APR ranges from 200% to 1350% and depends on your credit, chosen loan type, and state. </p>
                    <p>For personal loans, be ready to pay between 4.99% and 450% APRs, for cash advances – from 200% to 1386%, and installment options no more than 225%.</p>
                    <p>Since ExtraLend is an indirect lender, it is difficult to predict the loan offer you will get. Note that some lenders charge additional fees for early and late payments.</p>

                    <h3>Lend You</h3>
                    <p>Are you looking for a secure platform to get financial assistance? Lend You is an indirect lender that has an A rating with the Bureau of Better Business and many positive reviews from customers.</p>
                    <p>This company connects borrowers with reliable payday lenders that provide multiple solutions to financial problems. Available loan amounts depend on many factors and range from $100 to $15,000.</p>
                    <p>Payday loans allow you to borrow up to $1,000 and must be repaid in 30 days. At the same time, installment options have more extended repayment periods, which may account to 60 months.</p>
                    <p>Short-term loans typically come with higher APRs defined by direct lenders. For installment solutions, the fee is between 6.63% and 225%.</p>
                    <p>Apart from basic eligibility requirements, Lend You sets a minimum income criterion. Even to get a payday loan, you must earn more than $1,000 per month. If approved, borrowers receive funds on the following business day. </p>
                    <p>Like all the above-mentioned companies, Lend You requires your basic personal (name, phone number, email address, etc.) and banking information (checking account data).</p>

                    <h3>Check Into Cash</h3>
                    <p>Check Into Cash may also be a beneficial alternative to CashNetUSA if you need instant cash. This company offers different financial products, including payday loans, installments, car title solutions, and lines of credit.</p>
                    <p>This lender has more than 1,000 physical stores in 26 US states. You can apply for funds online or visit the nearest Check Into Cash office. Learn state laws before applying for money. Loan terms, conditions, and amounts vary. In some states, borrowers can’t get financial assistance online.</p>
                    <p>The company’s payday loans allow you to get between $50 and $1,500, depending on your state. However, new clients can get approved for a payday advance of $750. The maximum repayment term for this loan type usually doesn’t exceed 31 days.</p>
                    <p>Check Into Cash installment loans can be up to $5,000. You can repay them in weekly or monthly payments. This lender doesn’t charge a penalty for early installments.</p>
                    <p>What about interest charges? This company doesn’t have them. For payday loans, be ready to pay a flat fee ranging from $10 to $30 per $100 borrowed. It means that a payday advance APR may be from 400% to 1,000% in some states.</p>
                    <p>Remember that to qualify for a Check Into Cash payday loan, you must have a minimum annual income of $12,000 or higher. If you are unsure whether you will get approved, opt for a pre-qualification feature offered by this lender. </p>

                    <h3>Let’s Consider CashNetUSA</h3>
                    <p>Established in 2005, CashNetUsa is a reputable provider of cash loans online. The company's services are available in 29 US states. It offers several lending options, including payday, installment loans, and lines of credit.</p>
                    <p>The loan amount depends on various factors. If you apply for a payday loan, you can get between $100 and $600. At the same time, installment options allow you to borrow up to $3,500.</p>
                    <p>CashNetUsa charges relatively high interest charges that vary considerably from state to state. That is why you must learn state laws before applying for an online personal loan. The company has an appealing and convenient website and mobile application. It brings about an instant approval process. The borrowers usually receive money directly on their accounts within 1 business day.</p>
                    <p>If you are looking for fast financial help and are ready to face high APR (in some cases over 1,000%) and short repayment terms, CashNetUsa is worth considering. It doesn't conduct the borrowers' credit checks, so almost everyone can get approved.</p>

                    <h2>Why and When You Should Choose an Alternative To CashNetUSA</h2>
                    <p>CashNetUsa offers fast cash solutions and presents multiple benefits to borrowers. However, in some cases, you may need to look for other lenders. Why may it happen?</p>
                    <p>Firstly, for some lenders, the offered loan amount may not be enough. If you need more than $3,500, CashNetUsa is not for you.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, this lender doesn't provide secured loans. If you are looking for car title or mortgage options, you should find another lender.</p>
                    <p>Among other things, the company issues high interest rate loans. Because of a short loan term, you may end up in debt.</p>
                    <p>As mentioned, CashNetUsa provides financial assistance even to borrowers with bad credit. It doesn't report to three major credit bureaus, which means your loan request won't hamper your score. However, if you want to build credit, you should look for CashNetUsa alternatives.</p>
                    <p>Every cloud has a silver lining, even if it is one of the most reputable lending companies in the USA. Define the essential features a good loan app must have and try to find the most beneficial option. If CashNetUsa is not for you, there are still many great lenders to consider.</p>
