                    <p class="desc" style="text-align: justify;">PayDaySay is at present one of the leading service
                        providers in the financial sphere. <b>Our company is not a direct lender.</b></p>
                    <p class="desc" style="text-align: justify;">We have a wide network of cooperating service providers
                        and our customers can benefit from the best loan-matching mechanism in the sphere of personal
                        borrowing and business crediting.</p>
                    <p class="desc" style="text-align: justify;">Payday loans are the quickest and the easiest way
                        possible to get money for various needs urgently. Payday loan is a fast fix for whatever money
                        issues you have: a bill for a car repair, a hospital bill or a hole in the budget to be covered.
                        Let’s see how these pay day advances work today.</p>
                        
                            <p align="center">“Faxing of papers may be demanded,” and “Credit Pull may be conducted.” Later, your site must not demonstrate that the entire borrowing process will be totally done online – clients must be aware that occasionally the borrower may need to visit the nearest physical storefront location to finish the loan request process.</p>

                    <a href="/form./"> <img src="<?= get_template_directory_uri() . '/assets/img/Submit.jpg'?>" alt="how to take a loan"
                                               style="float: left; margin:7px 7px 7px 0px" class="images"></a><br><br>
                    <ul class="list-orange-mark">
                        <li><strong>Step one:</strong> write your personal and contact information.</li>
                        <li><strong>Step two:</strong> provide your employment details.</li>
                        <li><strong>Step three:</strong> specify your bank account details.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Enjoy the result!</p><br>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Make sure you have provided accurate information for the lender
                            to contact you as soon as possible. Your employment details will serve as the sign of your
                            credibility and the ability to pay the loan back. Your bank account details are needed for
                            the lender to transfer money to you directly once you’ve been granted a loan.</i></p>

                    <h3>How to Secure Yourself</h3>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Remember that we don’t give out loans. We simply represent the app
                        that connects you with the best lenders to assist your financial needs.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>In order to be sure of your information safety and
                            non-disclosure, please read the <a title="Terms and Conditions"
                                                               href="/terms-and-conditions/">terms</a> and agreement
                            carefully. </i></p>
                    <p>Also, before closing up the deal with the lender, read the fine print thoroughly. This way you’ll
                        be aware of the interest rate, the APR and the late repayment fees that the lender may
                        charge.</p>

                    <h3>How to Repay the Loan Appropriately</h3>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The lenders are extremely open about terms they issue a loan on.
                        Your task is to study all the information on the loan repayment terms before you sign the
                        agreement with the lender.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The loan repayment is conducted in two ways. To make things easier,
                        an automatic withdrawal of the loaned sum from your bank account can be arranged. Or, you can
                        cover the loan amount with a postdated check. Negotiate on the loan repayment conditions with
                        your lender early on.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Remember that late loan repayment has its consequences. The more you
                        prolong the repayment the bigger the interest rate is going to get. Use this information to your
                        advantage and try not to pay more than you owe.</p>
