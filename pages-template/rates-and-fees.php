            <h3><strong>Lender's Fees and Rates</strong></h3>
            <p>If you are connected with our cooperating lender and sent the agreement, read the contract information
                carefully. <strong>Check the exact terms including fees, interest rates, and other conditions.</strong>
                It’s solely your decision whether to continue with the request or not after the careful terms
                consideration.</p>
            <p><strong>The contract details between the customer and facility provider are not our company’s
                    competence</strong>. Thus, if you have questions concerning the fees, charges, interest rates or

            <h3><strong>APR – Representative Range Explanation</strong></h3>
            <p>APR means Annual Percentage Rate. This is the percentage of interest a borrower has to pay on a personal
                loan within the period of a year. Typically, consumers will have to pay higher interest rates if they
                request a smaller sum for a shorter period.</p>
            <p>PaydaySay is not a crediting agency or a cash advance broker, so we can’t say what the exact APR for each
                loan request will be. A certain APR of each loan depends on the creditor. </p>
            <p>Once the borrower is matched with the creditor and receives an offer, the creditor will mention the exact
                conditions of the lending contract, including the APR and any other fees and/or charges.</p>
            <p>APR differs among creditors and this percentage depends on some criteria including the amount you want to
                borrow, the details you mention, the interest rate, the loan length, additional fees and charges
                associated with the loan, as well as other factors. </p>
            <p><i><strong>Hence, we cannot state the precise APR but we can offer a sample range that creditors might
                        offer – from 200% to 2,290%. Everything depends on each lender as they calculate the APR of the
                        specific lending offer.</strong></i></p>
