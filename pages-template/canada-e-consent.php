            <h1>The App’s Consent for Electronic Signatures, Records, and Disclosures (“E-Consent”)</h1>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>You are submitting a request to be matched with one of our third party lenders. To offer you a loan, one
                or more of the third party lenders in our network of lenders need your consent to use and accept
                electronic signatures, records, legal disclosures, and other communications (“E-Consent”). The App makes
                no representations as to what, if any, communications you may receive from your lender.</p>
            <p>This is intended to put you on notice of your rights when receiving disclosures, notices, and
                information. By clicking “I Consent,” or other links assenting to our terms, you acknowledge that you
                received this E-Consent and that you consent to conduct transactions using electronic signatures,
                electronic disclosures, electronic records, and electronic contractual documents (“Disclosures”).</p>
            <h3>Option For Paper Records/Disclosures</h3>
            <p>If you would like to receive a paper copy of any Disclosures, please contact your third party lender
                directly. These Disclosures may be available to you by the third party lender. Please note, some lenders
                may charge a fee for sending you paper copies of Disclosures. The Lender will retain all Disclosures as
                the applicable law requires.</p>
            <h3>Scope of Consent</h3>
            <p>This E-Consent applies to all interactions online between and concerning you and the third party lender
                and includes interactions engaged in on any mobile device, including smart-phones, phones, and tablets.
                The third party lender, through this E-Consent, may process your information and interact during all
                online interactions with you electronically. You may also receive notices sent electronically from the
                lender related to your interactions and transactions with the third party lender. Disclosures may be
                provided online at the third party lender’s source(s).</p>
            <h3>Consenting to do Business Electronically and System Requirements</h3>
            <p>Prior to deciding whether or not to conduct business electronically with a third party lender, please
                first consider whether you have the hardware and software capabilities required to do so. To access,
                obtain, and retain Disclosures electronically, the following computer software and hardware are
                required: 1) A PC or MAC compatible computer or other device capable of accessing the Internet; 2)
                access to a working email account; and 3) an Internet Browser software program that can support at least
                128 bit encryption (i.e. Firefox, Internet Explorer, Netscape, etc.); 4) you may need Adobe Acrobat
                Reader X® or Foxit® to read some PDF documents; and 5) a printer or long-term storage device (i.e.
                computer disk drive). Please direct any questions you may have regarding these hardware and software
                requirements directly to the third party lender.</p>
            <h3>Modification of Consent Terms</h3>
            <p>The App reserves the right to modify these terms and conditions at our discretion, without notice.</p>
            <h3>Withdrawing Your Consent</h3>
            <p>Your E-Consent for our lender-matching service and for our third party lenders’ consideration of your
                matching request cannot be withdrawn as it is a one-time transaction. Its legal effectiveness, validity,
                and enforceability will not be affected if you choose to withdraw this E-Consent. Upon being matched
                with one or more third party lenders, you may withdraw your E-Consent with any of those third party
                lenders at any time, and at no charge to you. Please note, if you withdraw your E-Consent prior to
                receiving a loan, you may be prevented from obtaining a loan from the lender.</p>
            <h3>Change of Contact Information</h3>
            <p>Please keep the third party lender up-to-date of any change(s) to your electronic address or mailing
                address. To update your information, you may log into the third party lender’s source or send the third
                party lender your updated information via mail.</p>
            <h3>Your Ability to Access Disclosures</h3>
            <p>By clicking the link or “I consent,” you assent to the terms of this disclosure. You acknowledge that you
                can access the disclosures in the formats designated above.</p>
            <h3>Consent</h3>
            <p>By clicking the link or “I consent,” you assent to our terms. You acknowledge that you have read and
                understand this information about electronic signatures, records, disclosures, and doing business
                electronically. You consent to using electronic signatures, having all disclosures provided or made
                available to you electronically, and to doing business with the third party lender electronically. You
                acknowledge that you may request a paper copy of the electronic records and disclosures, to be provided
                to you upon request at no charge. You also acknowledge that your consent to electronic disclosures is
                required in order to receive services from third party lenders over the internet. If you do not proceed,
                then you do not wish to use electronic signatures or conduct this transaction electronically.</p>
