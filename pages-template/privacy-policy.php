            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

            <p>Effective: March 25, 2022</p>
            
            <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the "Payday Advance - Borrow Money" app (“App”) performed by FINANSOVA
                KOMPANIYA TESSELLA ASSET FINANS, TOV. It explains the services the App provides, tells about the
                information collected by the App.</p>
            <h3>Disclosure</h3>
            <p>The operator of the App is neither a lender nor a broker. The App doesn’t make any credit or
                finance-related decisions but offers the users a loan-connecting service. The App securely transfers the
                information the users provide to the third-party lenders that determine the APR, fees, and all the other
                loan terms.</p>
                
               
                 
            <h3>The Information the App Collects</h3>
            <p>The App collects both personally identifiable information that may identify a certain individual and
                non-personally identifiable information that identifies anonymous data that cannot be associated with a
                particular individual.</p>
            <p>Personally identifiable information is collected when the users complete the online application form to
                request a loan from a lender participating in the network or when they send questions to the App. This
                includes name, address, phone number, SSN, email, birth date, driver’s license number, citizenship
                status, employment details, amount and frequency of paychecks, information about home ownership, and
                your banking account.</p>
            <p>Non-personally identifiable information is collected either through the use of third-party tracking
                systems or directly through the use of ‘cookies’. This includes the user’s IP address, the browser type,
                access time, language, information about the links the user follows, and the areas of the App the user
                visits.</p>
            <p>Cookies are pieces of information a website sends to the user’s computer while the user is viewing a site
                to remember the user without personal identification.</p>
            <p>The App can share non-personally identifiable information with its suppliers and other third parties for
                the purpose of statistical and trend analysis.</p>
            <p>Third parties, like lenders and advertising partners, may be allowed to display advertisements on the
                App. These third parties can use cookies or other technologies to track and collect the information on
                the users interacting with their advertisements. The App doesn’t provide PII to these third parties.</p>
            <h3>How the App Uses Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
            <p>The PPI can be collected by the App to provide the requested service. The details the user provides in
                the application form are transferred to the partner lenders participating in the network. The
                information may be used to resolve disputes, address technical problems, or enforce agreements. The use
                of PII is limited to what is deemed necessary for providing the service.</p>
            <p>By submitting the personally identifiable information, the users consent that it can be shared with
                reliable third parties (in accordance with the applicable law), including the direct providers of
                financial options PaydaySay affiliated with. The information can be used for marketing services and
                advertising that may be defined as interesting to the user. PaydaySay reserves the right to share, sell,
                or otherwise disclose the users’ information to third parties.</p>
            <p>The operator of the App doesn’t have any access to the information the users provide in the application
                form. The loan requests the users submit are securely transferred to the trusted direct lenders
                participating in the web network.</p>
            <p>Providing the PII, the users permit the partner lenders to contact them regarding the loan request and
                processing. Thus, applicants waive the right to file any claims related to these contacts to the FTC or
                any other agency.</p>
            <h3>Sharing Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
            <p>The service offered by the App is provided by the third parties. The App can share your information with
                these third parties to provide better service. The App may also share personal information with the
                participating lenders, affiliates, and assignees whenever it is deemed necessary.</p>
            <p>The third parties have their own privacy policies describing the way they use and/or disclose personal
                information.</p>
            <p>The App discloses the PII in response to a court order, subpoena or similar investigative demand, request
                for cooperation from a law enforcement agency or other government agency; to establish or exercise the
                legal rights; to defend against legal claims, or as otherwise required by law. The PII may be also
                disclosed when it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activity,
                suspected fraud, or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of the
                parent company, its employees, its website users, or others; or to enforce the Terms and Conditions or
                other agreements or policies.</p>
            <h3>Opt-Out</h3>
            <p>When the users provide PII, they automatically opt-in. If the users get contacted by third parties, they
                have the right to opt-out of any further communications.</p>
            <h3>Other Sources</h3>
            <p>The App can link or automatically redirect the users to the third-party sources that don’t operate under
                this Privacy Policy. It is advised to review the terms of use as well as the privacy policies of the
                sources you are taken to, as the App doesn’t control or operate them.</p>
            <h3>Changes</h3>
            <p>The App policies, content, information, promotions, disclosures, disclaimers, and features may be
                revised, modified, updated, and/or supplemented at any time and without prior notice at its sole and
                absolute discretion.</p>
            <h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>
            <p>The App is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 18 or the age of majority in your
                jurisdiction. The App does not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from children under
                the age of 18.</p>
            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>The App uses security technologies to keep users’ information protected from unauthorized use, access,
                and/or disclosure. When the data is sent to the lenders over the Internet, it is protected by the Secure
                Socket Layer (SSL) protocol encryption.</p>
            <h3>Privacy Rights of California Residents</h3>
            <p>Companies that collect Personally Identifiable Information from California residents and disclose such
                information to third parties (including affiliated entities) for marketing purposes must, in response to
                a request by a consumer, either (1) provide a list detailing the categories of information shared and
                the entities to which such information was provided, or (2) provide a mechanism by which a consumer may
                opt out of having his or her information shared with third parties. The App has elected the second
                option, and you may opt out by completing one or more forms on our Opt Out page at
                http://www.optout-cpwh.net/o-cpwh-j53-9ff02092a7251ecbb8962c68939174ea.</p>
            <p>California residents are also entitled to know that they may file grievances and complaints with
                California Department of Consumer Affairs, 400 R Street, Suite 1080, Sacramento, CA 95814; or by phone
