					<h1 class="entry-title">What Are Pre-Settlement Loans?</h1>

					<p>In case you are in the middle of a lawsuit and urgently need some cash, it may be tempting to
						take out settlement loans until you win the case.</p>

					<p>While you are waiting for the lawsuit to settle (which may take time) you can face a mountain of
						payments, bills, and other necessary expenditures that need to be covered straight away. Some
						plaintiffs consider <a href="/best-ways-to-borrow-money/">borrowing cash</a> against the money they
						expect to obtain from the lawsuit – such decisions are called lawsuit loans or pre-settlement
						loans.</p>

					<?php echo do_shortcode('[money_fast_form action="/goto/application-form/" title="Need Money Fast?"]')?>

					<p>It may not always be a smart decision to get this type of financing. Let’s cover the basics of
						what lawsuit settlement loans are, how they work, as well as their main benefits and drawbacks.
						Hopefully, this information will help you make a wise decision that will suit your financial
						needs.</p>
					<h2>What Are Settlement Advance Loans?</h2>
					<p>Many people seek monetary assistance when they face personal injury lawsuits. For instance, if
						you were injured seriously or if you were hurt in a car accident and you can’t work for some
						time, costs tend to pile up and overdue bills become your best friend. In this case, structured
						settlement loans are designed to help you remain financially afloat while you are waiting for
						the lawsuit to settle.</p>
					<p>This lending solution can be beneficial on one hand but be rather expensive and time-consuming on
						the other hand. Like any other lending option, pre-settlement loans for auto accidents should be
						considered only when you have no other solution and urgently require financial aid.</p>
					<p>Remember that you will have to pay a high price for this option. On the other hand, such a
						decision can help you diminish stress when you are waiting for the end of the lawsuit as it may
						get even worse if you ignore your bills and payments.</p>
					<h3>Who Needs Lawsuit Cash Advance Loans?</h3>
					<p>These are not traditional lending services for every person. There are several types of borrowers
						who take out such solutions. They are not designed for every consumer in need as they were
						specially created as lawsuit loans without an attorney for:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Car accidents;</li>
						<li>Personal injuries;</li>
						<li>Injuries in the workplace;</li>
						<li>Medical malpractice;</li>
						<li>When you fall down;</li>
						<li>Product malfunction that causes injury;</li>
						<li>Negligence or other cases that led to wrongful death.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>How Do Loans for Legal Fees Work?</h3>
					<p>In order to receive financing, you should apply for loans on a settlement after you have filed a
						lawsuit. You won’t be able to get approved for this lending decision prior to filing a law
						settlement. After that, the finance-related service provider will review your case and evaluate
						your chances of winning this settlement. Yes, you may be rejected or approved depending on your
						personal situation.</p>
					<p style="border-left: 7px solid #5cbb16; text-align: left; padding-left: 10px; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic;">
						Nobody guarantees the creditor will want to fund your personal injury settlement loans if your
						chances are low. Lenders usually evaluate how much a plaintiff is expected to receive.</p>
					<p>Litigation funding isn’t the quickest way to obtain the necessary funds for your immediate needs.
						Creditors don’t just give you the money, they lend it and want to make more cash from personal
						injury lawsuit loans. Hence, the interest rates for this decision are typically sky-high. Once
						the lawsuit is settled, the creditor will take this money from you together with the fees and
						interest for the whole period.</p>
					<h3>Pros of Pre Settlement Funding Loans</h3>
					<p>There are certain advantages of turning to this assistance:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>You receive the cash for expenditures.</strong> The money obtained through this
							lending solution can help you fund urgent needs and cover immediate expenditures that you
							have no savings to fund. This way you will be able to avoid overdue bills and missed
							payments with late charges.
						</li>
						<li><strong>Loans for legal fees with bad credit.</strong> Generally, creditors won’t conduct a
							credit pull if you request this type of lending solution. They will review and evaluate
							other criteria before they make their decision to approve or reject your application.
						</li>
						<li><strong>Money can be obtained fast.</strong> In some cases, lenders may accept your
							application and approve it if it sounds beneficial to them and they are certain the funds
							will be returned with high fees.
						</li>
						<li><strong>This will give you extra time for negotiation.</strong> Even when you rack your
							brains trying to find the necessary funds urgently, you shouldn’t accept the very first
							offer the defendant tells you. Taking out loans against a lawsuit gives you an opportunity
							to relax and have some time to negotiate better terms.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Cons of Legal Settlement Loans</h3>
					<p>On the contrary, there are some drawbacks to this decision. You should keep in mind that:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Such loans come with sky-high interest rates.</b> In fact, these fees can be as high as
							60% annually. In some cases, borrowers end up paying much more than the initial sum they
							have actually borrowed. The smallest fee is 20% so you need to be careful and shop around
							for the best offer.
						</li>
						<li><b>Loans on a lawsuit may be time-consuming. </b>Some settlements last for a few years and
							you will have to pay interest rates for the whole period. This is a serious matter to
							consider.
						</li>
						<li><b>Such loans are not regulated by the government.</b> The <a
								href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/is-lawsuit-lending-regulated.html"
								target="_blank" rel="noopener">laws and regulations for legal fees loans</a> vary
							from state to state, but there are no federal laws at all. If you want to avoid pitfalls you
							should look around for reliable creditors who are certified and offer reasonable rates for
							their services. Otherwise, think about alternative lending solutions.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>How to Find Loans for Lawsuit from Reliable Creditors</h3>
					<p>It is necessary to evaluate all the benefits and downsides of applying for this type of financial
						assistance. Remember that lawsuit advance loans aren’t regulated by the federal government and
						there are hardly any set rules or laws for their usage. Thus, every creditor may want to get
						huge fees and make money from you.</p>
					<p>Always read the company’s feedback and rely on professional reviews of various service providers.
						Don’t sign the contract if you are unsure whether the company is legal. Another interesting fact
						is that sometimes borrowers might not pay the loans on lawsuit settlements off. This happens in
						case a borrower loses the case. That’s why not every creditor is eager to issue the funds or
						approve the request only with sky-high fees.</p>
					<h3>Be Careful with Your Lending Decisions</h3>
					<p style="border-left: 7px solid #5cbb16; text-align: left; padding-left: 10px; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic;">
						Borrowing money isn’t a game. You should understand all the pros and cons of what you are going
						to sign.</p>
					<p>Car accident settlement loans may be helpful for the period when you can’t work but still need to
						support your needs, pay bills, and other essentials. While you are waiting for the lawsuit to
						settle, it may be a sound decision to borrow some funds.</p>
					<p>However, you need to evaluate the risks and be responsible for the cash you obtain. It may turn
						out to be extremely expensive to repay this debt. More than that, such decisions aren’t
						regulated by law. You may also want to consider other options such as small personal loans,
						credit cards, or your family and friends. If you <a href="/need-money-desperately/">need
							money asap</a> consider alternative options first.</p>
