                    <p>A business acquisition is a process of purchasing the company that is based on the weak or strong
                        sides of the acquiring company. There is a little difference between purchase and acquisition
                        though.</p>
                    <p>In the result of the acquisition, two companies merge together and create a single but more
                        powerful company. The acquisition is built around the common goals and interests of two
                        companies.</p>

                    <p><strong>Still, the cost of business acquisition is usually quite high.</strong></p>
                    <p>When <a href="/small-business-loans/">financing a small business</a> acquisition, you can
                        apply to the SBA. Speaking of the SBA, it’s one of the most reliable ways to cover business
                        expenses. The SBA doesn’t give money to a seller financing business acquisition. It deals with
                        banks, who in their turn finance business owners.</p>
                    <p>With the help of the <a
                                href="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/getting-an-sba-7-loan-for-small-business-398040"
                                targret="_blank">7A loan</a>, businessmen can get up to $5 million to finance the
                        acquisition of the business.</p>
                    <p>SBA requirements are quite strict. Therefore, to get financing a small business acquisition from
                        the Small Business Administration a borrower should:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>have good credit;</li>
                        <li>provide 20% down payment;</li>
                        <li>three years of tax information;</li>
                        <li>proofs of creditworthiness;</li>
                        <li>and personal information.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>While looking for financing business acquisition, you can also apply for a conventional or term
                        loan from the commercial bank. In this case, banks require assets and the borrower must have
                        good credit and substantial track record in the sphere.</p>
                    <p>As a business acquisition financing, you can use a leveraged buy-out. This is a great way to
                        maximize your benefit but you have to be sure about the business because the losses are also
                        very solid and the impact on your credit is also big.</p>
