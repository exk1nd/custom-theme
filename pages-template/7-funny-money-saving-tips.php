                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Saving money is just like a diet. Whether you save to make a big
                        purchase or just want to get used to a frugal lifestyle, you have to be strong and learn to say
                        “no” to yourself. But is it worth taking everything so seriously and make such a big deal out of
                        it? Remember the good saying? If you can’t change the situation, change your attitude to it! If
                        by any reason you can’t get a short term loan online from PayDaySay and your current situation
                        requires a change of your financial behavior, try these funny money-saving tips and save up some
                        cash and have some fun!</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">No, not just call to the bank and tell them that you’re not going to
                        use your credit card for a while. <strong>Just put your credit cards in cold water and
                            freeze!</strong> Have you heard that some people obsessed with chocolate do the same, they
                        freeze chocolate so then they have to wait to eat it? Very inconvenient, isn’t it? If your
                        credit is far from perfect, learn <a href="/how-to-increase-credit-score/">how to improve it
                            fast</a>.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t do that too often!) You friends will not like it, even if
                        you’ll tell that you occasionally forgot your wallet at home so you’ll have to make many new
                        friends. But you can try going out with no wallet to <strong>see what you can do for
                            free</strong>! Make sure there are many things to do, especially in the center of your city.
                        Most likely, there are some entertainments and fairs where you can try goods for free.</p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #008000;">Tip#3: Go to the Grocery Store for Lunch</span>
                    </h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">As one out of many <a href="/best-apps-save-on-groceries/">ways
                            to save money in a grocery store</a>, you can take an advantage of food samples. If you
                        don’t mind other people trying food around you, it can be a good way to save up some dollars.

                    </h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Okay, maybe not really in restaurants, but when you’re in a café,
                        why not to take some packets of sugar, salt, pepper and ketchup with you? You never know when
                        you may need something of it! Also, do not forget about napkins and plastic appurtenances! For
                        example, if each time you buy get take away coffee you get extra packets of sugar with you, one
                        day you can find out you have enough and skip buying it in a store!</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">After the grocery shopping, put everything to the fridge and make a
                        picture. Next time you go shopping you take a <strong>look at the picture and you already know
                            what you need to buy</strong>! That saves your time and your money because if you’ll do some
                        self-control, you will buy nothing extra!</p>

                    <img title="do your hair" alt="do hair for free" width="300" height="200" src="<?= get_template_directory_uri() . '/assets/img/hair-300x200.jpg'?>"

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Ignore this tip if you have an important date with someone you
                        really like and your relationship has a long term perspective. But if it’s just a meeting, then

                                style="color: #008000;">Tip#7: Do Your Hair/Make Up for Free</span></h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">There are many beauty schools and students there need models to show
                        up the results of their study. <strong>Check such schools online</strong> and see if they need
                        models for haircuts, make up, nails or other beauty procedures. In some occasions it can be done
                        absolutely for free and sometimes with a very good discount. In any case, it’s much cheaper than
                        going to a regular beauty salon!</p>
