                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The Great Recession of 2008 significantly changed American banking
                        industry. Most banks have faced serious financial problems including those called “too big to
                        fail”. Fortunately, the American economy has finally recovered after the world financial crisis
                        and big banks are on top again.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">They have recovered their strength and got back with improved assets
                        and quite strong profits. US banks have made more than $40 billion within just the second
                        quarter. This significant income growth is caused by loans sales, most banks feel confident and
                        lend money to consumers and companies.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Also, we can notice consumers&#8217; activity increase. <strong>Americans
                            borrow more money because they believe in the stability of banks and see an economic
                            growth. </strong>Small business lending is back in the game again.<strong><br/>
                        </strong></p>

                    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Healthy Industry</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Financial experts say that today banking industry is really healthy
                        and strong. Around 300 deals were announced within last year when in 2013 the figure was a
                        little bit more than 200. These results can be called impressive because in 2011 US banks have
                        made only 150 deals.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">But except good news, there are also bad ones. The four largest
                        American banks have piled on almost $123 billion in crisis and home loan related settlements –
                        this data is provided by SNL. <strong>Bank of America has racked up almost $74 billion</strong>.
                        Here is one more concern: net investment edges on account of the augmented low premium rate
                        environment.</p>
                    <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Top-5 Banks and Positions Taken by the Giants</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">SNL has provided data to Forbes magazine to create the <a
                                href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2014/12/22/americas-best-and-worst-banks-2015/#62af412367d3"
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of worst and best American banks</a> to make the
                        situation clear to everybody. This ranking was made concerning three the most important points:
                        profit, quality of assets and adequacy of the capital. Regarding all these factors:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #339966;"> <strong>Signature Bank (New York) can be called the best American bank in 2014</strong></span>.
                        This bank was opened in 2001 but its assets’ grows really impresses – now it’s around $27
                        billion and it has around 30 offices in New York. But CEO of the bank says that their team isn’t
                        going to stop on these results and they plan further development.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Fortunately, there is a lot of space where they can put their
                        offices. Signature Bank serves mostly private businesses with at least $20 million income and
                        pays enough attention to law firms so hard to say that it’s focused on regular consumers and
                        those who want to benefit with small business loans.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #339966;">The second place is taken by Bank of Hawaii</span>.</strong>
                        This bank stays conservative and keeps its strategy. It’s the best banks concerning equity
                        returns within last year.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Other banks of TOP-5 are <span style="color: #339966;"><strong>SVB Financial Group, Bank United and State Street</strong></span>.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">As for four biggest banks, they are not so successful anymore so
                        their performance within last year can be called quite weak.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Like this we can find <span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Citigroup under #64</strong>, <strong>JP Morgan under #73</strong>, <strong>Wells Fargo at under #82</strong></span>.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">It’s worth noticing that Wells Fargo is still the most profitable
                        bank of the biggest banking institutions in the US.</p>
                    <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Top 10 Worst Banks</h3>
                    <p>Here is the list of the worst US banks. They are:</p>

                        <li>Doral</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Now it is time to make a choice what bank you want to be a part of.</p>
