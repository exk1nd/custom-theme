                    <p>As one of the biggest platforms of alternate lending, LendingClub is now facing big issues.
                        Unsecured personal loans from $1000 to $35 000 were the main product of the service. However,
                        while the company was established in 2006, <strong>today it threatens the whole financial
                            technology sector</strong>.<br/>
                        <span id="more-3884"></span></p>
                    <p><em>Also, <a href="/form/">check unsecured personal loans from $1 000 to $5 000</a>.</em></p>
                    <p>But what exactly has happened to the pioneer of the lending industry? What made their stock drop
                        in price? It is only a matter of time before this whole situation influences the loan market.
                        This is why financially savvy people should learn about the situation and make conclusions.</p>
                    <h2>Details of the Fraud</h2>
                    <p>The investigation has shown that one of the clients applied to a $22 million loan that did not
                        correspond to buying criteria. It should be mentioned that the client indicated that this kind
                        of loan is faulty in the first place. Later it was exposed as a fraud.</p>
                    <p><strong>The data about the loan agreement was forged as the dates on the expired documents were
                            altered</strong>. This was willingly done by the company&#8217;s engineer Andreas Oesterer.
                        Nonetheless, the man claims that this was done in accordance with the order from the vice
                        president of the company Matt Wierman.</p>
                    <p>Once the <a
                                href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-the-final-days-of-lendingclub-ceo-renaud-laplanche-1463419379"
                                rel="noopener" target="_blank">chief director of LendingClub Renaud Laplanche</a>
                        learned about the situation he decided to handle this deal while avoiding the committee of
                        directors. However, the fraud was exposed after an internal audit carried out by an independent
                        law firm.</p>
                    <p>On the 9th of May, Laplanche was resigned, though he had a chance to leave by his own will. This
                        very day the company received a message from the Ministry of Justice for trial.</p>
                    <h2>Opinion of Experts</h2>
                    <p>The client base was alerted by these events. After all, LendingClub was a giant of the financial
                        technology sector and its former success influenced the whole market. Today numerous competitors
                        of the company have to work with Wall Street to guarantee stable capital inflows.</p>
                    <p>Some experts believe that this situation proves that lending can bite you back. There is a
                        certain risk unless the client is 100% sure about the outcome and familiar with all details.
                        Sadly, not all companies play fair and end up feeding their clients with false promises. In the
                        end, it might be a good chance to expose those cheaters and help their potential clients avoid
                        unnecessary risk.</p>
                    <p><strong>While LendingClub stock is getting cheaper, the whole market experiences
                            hardship</strong>. Nonetheless, it can become a decent opportunity for companies that
                        conduct fair business to get some attention.</p>
                    <h3>Possible Outcome</h3>
                    <p>As soon as the information about the fraud was exposed, numerous investors ceased to provide
                        funds and started to withdraw their money. Officials of LendingClub admit that unless something
                        changes, they will have serious budgeting problems. Needless to say that some of the investors
                        and clients will never turn to the company again.</p>
                    <p>The administration of the company will have to look for additional funds and decrease the number
                        of loans they provide to handle the crisis. However, this is not the only issue LendingClub has
                        to deal with. It is vital to resolve the investigation carried out by the Ministry of Justice
                        and a few other litigators including the client himself.</p>
                    <p>The stock price and shattered reputation are not helping and the future of LendingClub looks
                        grim. But the worst part is that the whole lending market has to adjust. These events forced the
                        Securities Commission to check other lenders as well. It is only natural that from now on all
                        clients will be extra cautious even with well-known companies. The best advice is to be aware of
                        these checks and eliminate lenders that are unworthy of your trust.</p>
                    <p>However, as we see now, Lending Club has managed to recover and gather lots of good reviews
                        online.</p>
