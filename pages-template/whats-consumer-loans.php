                    <h2>What Does Consumer Loan Mean?</h2>
                    <p>A consumer loan is a <a href="/short-term-loans/">small short-term loan</a>, which potential
                        borrowers need for small purchases. Household and personal needs are usually the main purposes
                        of the clients. Lenders state that usually, people apply for consumer loan to pay for a certain
                        item – usually item of clothes or technique.</p>
                    <p>As well as lots of other loans, consumer loans are unsecured if a client is creditworthy and
                        secured if a client doesn’t qualify for the loan. In fact, nothing discerns this offer from
                        other loans, on the surface. Still, you have to know the key characteristics of the consumer
                        loans.</p>
                    <h3>Terms of Consumer Loans</h3>
                    <p>Consumer loans online are popular nowadays as borrowers consider them to be fast and easy. Most
                        of the websites don’t require a credit check. <strong>Sometimes online lenders offer consumer
                            loans with bad credit</strong>. Most of the lenders also promise no paperwork, quick
                        approval, ability to withdraw cash within one day.</p>
                    <p>It sounds attractive and those, who urgently need money usually, believe in this. Unfortunately,
                        all of this is nothing against the high-interest rates. Consumer loans are known to offer higher
                        interest rates than <a href="/small-personal-loans/">personal loans</a>, for instance.
                        Sometimes clients justify it by the urgent need of money. Moreover, when the amount of the loan
                        is small, clients can cope with it.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, every customer has to be aware of the credit report, which lenders, actually,
                        require. Attractive affordable terms are cool but every lender wants to be sure that a client
                        will manage to pay off the debt. In fact, every lender might change the package of documents.
                        Still, you must be ready to provide a credit report with a suitable credit score!</p>
                    <p>Consumer loans don’t require any guarantor. A guarantor is a person, who can assure lenders that
                        a borrower will pay off the debt. Though this type of loan sometimes requires collateral, there
                        are no packages with guarantor as a requirement.</p>
                    <h3>Types of Consumer Loans</h3>
                    <p>In fact, it’s possible to find consumer loans for all types of people – students, job seekers,
                        and people with different levels of income. Obviously, the terms for each kind of group will
                        discern:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Students, for instance, can apply for the students’ loan. They aren’t usually large as are
                            dedicated to such purchases as tuition and books, living expenses, or food.
                        </li>
                        <li>Credit cards debts, if they are used for personal purchases, are also qualified as consumer
                            debts.
                        </li>
                        <li>Surprisingly, but mortgages, though their large amount of a debt, are considered to be
                            consumer loans as well.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>There are also single-payments loans that are known as balloon loans and bridge loans. Usually,
                        borrowers have to pay the debt off during one period. It’s a good variant as a temporary loan.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Who Can Qualify for Consumer Loan?</h3>
                    <p>Most of the people, who look for ‘consumer loans near me’ online, often face the tempting offers.
                        As it was mentioned before, most of the lenders promise no credit score check.</p>
                    <p>Still, there is hardly a lender, who will agree to provide a person with a bad credit with a
                        large sum of money.</p>
                    <p>Yes, most of the lenders don’t insist on the impressive credit score. But they have specific
                        requirements, which potential clients have to qualify for.</p>
                    <p>In fact, consumer loans are a good decision when you need fast financial help. Still, you must
                        always consider specific risks connected with consumer credits!</p>
