                    <p>When you decide to refinance a timeshare loan, you should understand that this process isn’t
                        easy. The refinancing carries out a high risk both for commercial and private banks. They rather
                        consider it a bad investment because the timeshare loans include annual maintenance, assessment
                        fees, and mortgage payment. If you can’t provide powerful proof of your creditworthiness, the
                        lender will more likely to refuse you.</p>
                    <h2>What Are Timeshare Loan Refinancing Options?</h2>
                    <p>Still, if you have good credit, you have a couple of reasonable timeshare loan refinancing
                        options.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>There are companies that deal with timeshare loan refinancing</strong>. There are
                            situations when borrowers don’t want to deal with their lenders directly. In such cases, you
                            can turn to the timeshare loan re-financiers. Still, don’t forget that the interest rates
                            are usually higher.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>The resale value of the timeshare is lower and the loan is less reliable</strong>.
                            If you can’t find a lending institution that will be ready to refinance a loan, you can
                            offer your home and get a home equity loan. In the result, you get a larger sum to pay off
                            the timeshare. The rest of the payments (home equity) are much lower.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>If you still can’t figure out how to get out of a timeshare loan, you can try credit
                                card refinance</strong>. This option is good for its lower monthly and interest payments
                            (often 5%-10% lower).
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>You can also borrow again your <a href="/unsecured-personal-loans/">personal
                                    unsecured loan</a> or 401(k) retirement account to refinance timeshare loan</strong>.
                            Still, don’t make the fast decision. You should consult with an expert and figure out
                            whether the profit from the refinancing is worth the risk of long-term financing. For this
                            purpose, you can use the timeshare loan calculator and calculate the profit yourself.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These are the most popular ways to refinance your timeshare loan. The process is complicated and
                        not beneficial but you still can find a reasonable variant.</p>
