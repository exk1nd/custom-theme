					<h1> Best Cash Advance Apps (Financial Help in Your Pocket)</h1>
					<p>Payday loans are no stranger to <a
							href="https://www.gobankingrates.com/saving-money/budgeting/americans-living-paycheck-paycheck/"
							target="_blank"> nearly half of all Americans who live paycheck to paycheck</a>. Yet, there is a
						quicker way to get the money.</p>
					<p>Being in need of money is very unpleasant indeed. But if there’s nothing else to do, opt for a
						paycheck app that would be a great alternative to cash advances before your next payday.</p>

							<strong> How many times in your life have you faced <a href="/need-money-desperately/"> desperate
									money need</a> ?</strong></li>
					</ul>

					<p>We know that sticking to a budget is a tough gig. That’s why Earnin, Brigit or budgeting tools like
						Dave come to your aid. With a good financial app, money management becomes easy.</p>
					<p>In an ideal world, everyone has an emergency fund to deal with unexpected expenses. But the reality
						makes us believe the contrary. One day you may need instant cash to cover utility bills, car repair,
						or anything else. And in times when even good financial habits are not enough to save you from a
						significant expense popup, "get your paycheck early" app is extra help without taking a side
						hustle.</p>

					<p>
					<center><em> <strong>What is the best get paid now app you may ask. And millions will answer "It
								depends";</strong> </em></center>
					</p>
					<hr/>
					<p>Thus, if you are ready to find the best app to get paid early, make yourself a coffee and learn all
						the bells whistles of the below-mentioned paycheck apps.</p>
					<p>But before thinking on your feet, make sure you know your reason for getting a cash advance. And
						remember that there is hardly a great personal loan that wouldn’t ask for something in return. In this
						case, it’s all about money and interest rate you’ll face or not.</p
					<p>All in all, no matter what money borrowing app you’ll end up with, you’re the one who is responsible
						for your choice. So, think twice.</p>

					<h2>5 Best Cash Advance Apps</h2>
					<p> The following is a list of the best mobile banking options to get paycheck advances and bridge the
						financial gap. Account users can receive the cash fast without harsh credit checks.</p>

					<p> Find what app suits you best and use it only when you’re strapped for cash. These options can save
						you from serious financial troubles, so do research before getting your fingers wet.</p>

					<h3> PaydaySay – Payday Advance Loan App </h3>

					<p><img src="<?= get_template_directory_uri() . '/assets/img/app-paydaysay-1.png' ?>" width="35%"
					        align="right" alt="Payday Advance Loan App" style="margin: 3px 0px 0px 15px;"> Payday Say app is
						a tool that can help you get connected with one of the trusted payday loan lenders. Install it once on
						your phone and get ready to solve your short-term financial difficulties in just a few clicks.</p>

					<p> The app offers a safe loan application available 24/7 and gives you access to a pool of lenders thus
						making it possible to qualify for a small loan fast and even with bad credit.</p>
					<p style="border-left: 7px solid #3868e5; ; text-align: left; padding-left: 18px; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 16px;">
						<em> The app is not a direct lender but a loan-connecting service that matches the account holders
							with the lending institutions that review and decide on the consumers’ loan requests within a few
							business days.</em></p>
					<p> It means that borrowers have multiple loan options to get extra money. When it comes to finding a
						reliable way to take a short-term loan, PaydaySay is the app that comes in handy. It is easy, quick
						and can help you solve your small money problems in minutes.</p>
					<p align="center"><a href="https://paydaysay.onelink.me/qgw2/advanceapps" style="color:#000;"> <img
								src="<?= get_template_directory_uri() . '/assets/img/icon-b-App-Store.svg' ?>" loading="lazy"
								alt="money borrowing" title="quick loan" width="139" height="47" align="center"> </a>

								alt="advance loan app" title="borrow money" width="139" height="47" align="center"> </a></p>

					<p> If you need some cash to make ends meet until the next paycheck or there is an urgent bill you should
						pay asap, PaydaySay is one of the good ways to borrow loan amounts ranging from $100 up to $1000.</p>
					<p><strong> It’s great to have a financial assistant in your pocket, right?</strong> Still, take
						advantage of the money borrowing apps wisely and take even a small loan seriously not to get into deep
						debt.</p>

					<h3> Earnin – Pay Advance App for Hourly Paid Workers</h3>
					<p><img src="<?= get_template_directory_uri() . '/assets/img/app-earnin.png' ?>" width="25%"
					        align="right" alt="apps like earnin" style="margin: 3px 0px 0px 25px;">Earnin is an interest
						free/low-fee alternative to payday loans. Formerly known as ActiveHours, it works differently from
						other apps.</p>
					<p> Thus, as a cash app alternative to expensive payday loans, it allows you to access the money you’ve
						already earned but haven’t been paid for.</p>
					<p>The app has extra features like the Balance Shield Alert which notifies users when their account
						balance is low. The great thing about the Balance Shield Alert is the fact that Earnin actually sends
						an amount to your direct deposit account to avoid overdraft fees when the balance goes below the
						amount previously specified.</p>
					<ul>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Loan amount: $100 to $500</li>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">APR: 9.95% up to 35.99%</li>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Minimum Credit Score: No minimum credit score required
						</li>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Credit check: No credit check or credit report necessary
							– only a bank account or direct deposit account
						</li>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">BBB Rating: A-</li>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Fees: There are no mandatory fees needed to use the app
							or checking account
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">No small-dollar loans fee or interest rates that allow
							you to save money;
						</li>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">App sends alerts when the balance is low</li>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Early access to paycheck</li>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Great for employees with electronic timesheets and
							specific work location
						</li>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Optional tip donation, capped at only $14</li>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Balance Shield Alert to notify against overdraft fees
						</li>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Health Aid feature offers assistance on medical bills.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Withdrawal limits are low</li>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">App can only be accessed by users with direct deposit
						</li>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Timesheet required as proof of employment</li>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Without a timesheet, a geographic location of the
							workplace is needed
						</li>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Balance Shield Alert can only protect your account once
							for free
						</li>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Recurring Balance Shield requires a certain fee of around
							$1.50
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p><i> In other words, you use your next paycheck as collateral to get money “lightning-fast”, which
							means the same day.</i></p>
					<p> Before you go for the Earnin app, consider that there are specific limits and rules. Unlike most cash
						advance and payday lenders, Earnin offers fee-free cash solutions. The app doesn't charge interest or
						monthly membership fees, which seems like a great option to use apps like Earnin.</p>
					<p><b> Instead, the company encourages you to “tip” for using their services.</b></p>
					<p> And when you do, it increases your chances to get a max payout every paycheck. Just because they are
						not employer-sponsored, apps similar to Earnin don’t have customer service.</p>
					<p style="border-left: 7px solid #ba3c90; ; text-align: left; padding-left: 18px; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 16px;">
						<em> Thus, you can cash out $100 per pay period and increase it up to $ 500 in time. The longer you
							use the app, the higher the amount. The money lending app is easy to use, and it helps you avoid
							being late on bills or payments. Also, Earnin is a great cash advance app that helps you avoid
							taking out a payday loan.</em></p>


					<p> Thanks to the ‘get your paycheck early’ apps you skip the choice agony.
						Say, you don’t have to choose between missing a payment and paying the penalties. With Earnin, you get
						paid before payday a week or two early. So, a great alternative which can save you a great deal of
						money when you need it most.</p>
					<p><b> If, for some reason, this borrow money app is not an option for you, consider using Earnin
							alternatives.</b></p>

					<h3> Dave</h3>
					<p><img src="<?= get_template_directory_uri() . '/assets/img/app-dave-1.png' ?>" width="40%" align="left"
					        alt="cash advance apps like dave" style="margin: 3px 20px 0px 0px;"> The Dave app is the other
						cash advance alternative to payday loans that aims to help you change your status when strapped for
						cash. Loan apps like Earnin and Dave are innovative <strong> AI-based platforms that work directly
							with your checking account</strong> .</p>
					<p> Once your funds are low, you get an alert and you’re able to get as many cash boosts as necessary.
						Even though the loan amount starts from $75, apps like Earnin and Dave come with great terms and
						excellent reputation. As proof, since their startup in 2016,<a
							href="https://www.businessinsider.com/review-of-dave-mark-cubans-overdraft-killing-app-2019-6"

					                 align="left" alt="Loan Apps" style="margin: 3px 12px 0px 0px;">Struggle with automatic
							payments for things like Netflix or insurance?</strong></p>
					<p> That’s where the friendly app can help. The good news is there are no credit checks. For quick
						approval, you need to have 60 days’ worth of payment history.</p>
					<p> Thus, Dave is not the other app that lets you get money but the one that also helps you monitor your
						budget.</p>
					<p>When on the lookout for the best loan options, apps like Dave and Earnin should be high on your
						list.</p>
					<ul>

						</li>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">BBB Rating: Dave app has a BBB rating of B</li>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Fees: Instead of interest rates. Dave only requests
							donations in tips.
						</li>
					</ul>

					</ul>
					<p style="border-left: 7px solid #5cbb16; text-align: left; padding-left: 10px; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic;">
						It’s hard to find a reason not to give Dave a try. Unless you think 200 thousand reviews isn’t enough
						proof. For $1/month, cash advance apps like Dave allow you to budget your upcoming expenses.</p>
					<p>In fact, it’s one of the best overdraft protection apps that save you a bundle. Yet, one thing all
						best apps similar to Dave lack is customer support.</p>

					<h3> MoneyLion – App with Payday Membership</h3>

					<h3> Brigit – Best Payday Loans App for Fast Funding</h3>
					<p><img src="<?= get_template_directory_uri() . '/assets/img/app-brigit-1.jpg' ?>" width="26%"
					        align="right" alt="apps like moneylion" style="margin: 3px 0px 10px 30px;"> Payday loan apps like
						<a href="https://www.hellobrigit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Brigit</a> work best for saving
						on overdraft fees. For a monthly membership fee of $9.99/month, you can get up to $250 per paycheck
						with no interest payments or credit check quality.</p>
					<p><em><b>There is one thing you should know before going for Brigit:</b></p>
					<p> It uses an algorithm to forecast the balance in the bank account at the end of the month, which
						simply makes Brigit a cut above the other apps that loan you money. It predicts whether your bank
						account will run out of cash before the next paycheck.</em></p>
					<p>If that’s your case, you’ll get up to $250, which you repay once you get paid. Since this
						get-paid-early app is based on a subscription model, <b>you never pay interest in late fees on the
							loan up to $250</b>. Thus, once you repay your loan, you get access to it again and again.</p>
					<p>Unlike AI-based platforms like Dave and Earnin, this payday advance app comes with a responsive
						customer service team.</p>
					<p style="border-left: 7px solid #4ab356; text-align: left; padding-left: 10px; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic;">
						You just need to connect your timecard and your bank account and get ready to access the money
						instantly. Though Brigit is one of the best overdraft apps available to everybody, it isn’t
						necessarily the best choice.</p>
					<p> Ideal for people with thin or low credit scores, Brigit is much less expensive than an overdraft fee
						(could be up to $40 depending on the bank). As such, if you face some financial troubles from time to
						time, Brigit is a decent option.</p>

					<h2>Varo</h2>
					<p>Varo was founded back in 2015 as a mobile application that offers mobile savings and checking

					<h2>What are Cash Advance Apps?</h2>
					<p>Cash Advance apps can help users jumpstart their current cash flow in a cost-effective way. There are
						no interest rates for most cash advance apps and may only require a minimal monthly subscription for
						under $10.</p>
					<h3>How Cash Advance Apps Work?</h3>
					<p>Basically, cash advance apps allow income earners to have funds deposited directly to their bank
						account even before payday. The payment will be automatically deducted from the same checking account
						on the date specified in the agreement. In this way, cash advances allow people to borrow the funds
						they have already earned. This short-term solution issues extra cash via a direct deposit on the
						borrower’s debit card.</p>
					<p>Just by the name, cash is deposited in a user’s bank account in advance. Most cash advances, payroll
						advance apps or payday advance apps set eligibility requirements. They may include the proof of
						employment ke a timesheet to check the cash flow. This is very convenient for employees with
						electronic timesheets. </p>
					<p>Cash advance lenders do it to ensure you can repay the loan amount. The sum credited in advance will
						then be automatically deducted when you receive the next pay.</p>
					<figure class="wp-block-pullquote">
						<blockquote><p>Cash advance apps offer small amounts ranging from around $5 to $300 due to the
								expected salary.</p></blockquote>
					</figure>
					<p>Cash advance apps may also charge fees for their products and services. Most of them require a
						membership fee, optional tips, or monthly subscriptions starting at $1. The membership fee is the
						amount of money a user pays per month. These monthly subscriptions are due monthly regardless of how
						seldom or often the app is used. Tips are optional and apps swear that every user gets the same
						quality of products or services regardless of tips.</p>
					<h3>How to Get Cash in Advance?</h3>
					<p>Various payday loans apps have different dashboards or layouts but generally offer similar financial
						products. Here are some ways to get Cash in Advance through online apps.</p>
					<ol>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Download the Cash Advance App of your choice</li>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Register and open your account</li>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Login to your account</li>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Setup Cash advance terms</li>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Receive Cash in a designated bank account</li>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The pay period for is usually scheduled when payday
							comes
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>It is that easy! Just make sure to follow the directions depending on the loan app of your choice.
						Some apps do not require a bank account but may provide users with a credit line that can be used for
						purchases. Make sure to pay on time within the scheduled pay period or on the date specified to avoid
						paying for fees and charge interest fees.</p>

					<h2>Should You Use Cash Advance Apps?</h2>
					<p>
						Cash advances provide quick cash without hard credit checks. You can apply for this personal
						loan even with a bad credit score. Advance lenders pay attention to your income,
						not a credit history.
					</p>
					<p>
						At the same time, the ability to get funds within a few minutes can
						cost you more than other loan solutions. A loan app may charge membership and overdraft fees.
						If you miss the due date, you may also face late fees. The repayment terms are usually short
						and may not be enough to repay the debt.
					</p>
					<p>
						It means that cash advances should be used only in emergencies. Online lending platforms send
						direct deposits on the borrowers’ accounts instantly. But before you apply for this option
						make sure you can repay the debt.
					</p>

						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Fees</strong></li>
					</ul>
					<p>There are apps that do not charge interest and registration fees but require a recurring monthly fee
						regardless of activity on the app. Make sure to weigh all the fees involved and choose the most
						cost-effective one. Sometimes, it would be better to pay for a one-time registration fee than a
						recurring monthly fee regardless of usage.</p>
					<ul>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Repayment terms</strong></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Most cash advance apps require payment within 7 days or by scheduled payday. But there are also
						options to extend in exchange for a fee. So make sure to consider the term and pay period on time to
						avoid additional charges. Before confirming the payment schedule, make sure that payroll is indeed
						scheduled on that date.</p>
					<ul>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Cash Limits</strong></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Not all apps offer cash advances or the same amount of loanable cash. There are apps that are limited
						to $100 but some can offer more. Once repaid, this said loanable amount may also increase. So, make
						sure to loan an amount that will be fully covered by your payroll.</p>
					<ul>
						<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Customer Reviews</strong></li>
					</ul>
					<p>It is always a wise decision to read customer reviews to get a good hold of customer satisfaction. If
						other users are not satisfied with the app’s performance, you are more than likely to experience the
						same kind of service.</p>

					<h3>Cash Advance Apps No Credit Check</h3>
					<p>When it comes to borrowing money with no credit check, there’s neither a quick solution nor an easy
						way out. Even if an emergency happens and you need money in a hurry, the best thing you should do
						before jumping in with both feet is to think carefully. Of course, in times when every second counts,
						and you have no time for side gigs, cash advances may become a helping hand.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong> But who will pay back all those mountains of interest at the end of the day if not
								you?</strong></li>
					</ul>
					<p> If a payday loan no credit check seems like a perfect match for you, think again. Chances are you’re
						one of those users who spend 90% of mobile time in apps. The world just lives in it, so you are.
						Getting money in advance is right at your fingertips.</p>
					<p>The number of apps that let you receive money abounds even with bad credit and sees no end in sight.
						No matter your reason, there is at least one payday app that can help before your next paycheck.</p>
					<p>Most of the best payday advance apps include tools that help you keep your financial wellness in
						tip-top shape. In times when some get paid today apps can help improve your credit score, other fast
						money apps help cover your financial shortfall.</p>
					<p>Now, what is your case?</p>

					<h2>Useful Hacks for Using Cash Advance Apps</h2>
					<p>Online lending platforms are easy to use and navigate. You can submit an online application
						or apply to customer support to get quick cash loans. At the same time, if you are not
						prepared to face such financial technology, you may suffer from multiple temptations.
					</p>
					<p>We have prepared some helpful tips to help you take maximum advantage of a cash advance app.
						They are worth reading before taking a personal loan if you don’t want to waste your time
						and money.
					</p>

					<h2>Review Lender Before Taking a Loan</h2>
					<p>
						It is essential to know that most apps with a cash advance feature don’t issue money.
						They work as mediators between borrowers and direct lenders that empower cash advances.
					</p>
					<p>
						That is why loan terms and conditions differ a lot. And here, you must be attentive! It is
						essential to learn the percentage rate, bank overdraft fees, and loan repayment period a lender
						offers. Remember that small print usually contains the most essential and unpleasant information
						for you. Read them to avoid hidden fees.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you have a poor credit score, look for lenders that provide soft checking solutions.
						Such lenders won’t spoil your rating by reporting to major credit bureaus.
					</p>
					<p>Since you are paying a fee for using a lending app, you have the right to choose between different
						options as long as you need it.</p>

					<h2>Understand How Much You Need</h2>
					<p>
						Unfortunately, fee-free loans don’t exist. For financial services, you must pay an APR and
						interest rate. What’s more, if you miss payments, you may face late fees.
						All these service fees may lead to more significant financial problems.
					</p>
					<p>
						That is why it is essential to understand how much money you need to get on your checking
						account. Try to be objective and remember that you must cover this debt within a pay period
						which is usually very short.
					</p>

					<h2>Build Up an Emergency Fund</h2>
					<p>
						Loan products appear to be fast and convenient. Since they are easy to get, people may be
						trapped in a vicious circle of debts.
					</p>
					<p>
						That is why an emergency fund is better even than the most reliable cash advance app. It
						may be challenging to save money if you haven’t done it before. Anyway, money management
						skills are pivotal today.
					</p>
					<p>
						You should start with small but regular contributions to a separate debit card. It is better
						to automate your savings and open a saving account. Deposit money and try to forget about your
						savings for a while. It is also important not to use credit cards during this period. At first,
						you may feel like you can’t make ends meet, but you will be grateful to yourself in the future.
					</p>
					<h2>Pay Off Your Debt on Time </h2>
					<p>
						If you apply for a personal loan, you must understand that missed paydays can spoil your credit
						report considerably. Consequently, you won’t be able to get your money using loan services and
						even go bankrupt.
					</p>
					<p>
						That is why following the deadlines and depositing money in your bank account is essential. If
						you are afraid to forget about the due date, set a push notification in your app and check the
						card’s balance from time to time.
					</p>
					<h2>Alternatives to Cash Advance Apps</h2>
					<p>There are plenty of alternatives to cash advance apps. Generally, cash advance apps provide lower
						rates and faster turnaround times. Also, payday cash advance apps need to be paid by payday or fees
						will be incurred. So here are other financing options you can take a look into:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong> Installment Loans</strong></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Installment loans need to be paid in scheduled and regular installments. If payment is not done on
						time, fees may be charged. So, if a user is not able to pay within the scheduled per pay period 2
						months in a row, interest rates will be charged for both unpaid months.</p>
					<p> Examples of installment loans may include real estate loans, car or auto loans, and even student
						loans. The advantage of installment loans is that it includes flexible short-term loans at lower rates
						but terms may be longer as well. Also, if a client fails to pay multiple times, collateral may be
						ceased by the lending institution by default.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Personal Loans</strong></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Personal loans are loans applied for to pay for personal finance or unexpected expenses and may be
						secured with collateral or unsecured depending on the lending institution and amount of loan. A
						personal loan may cover upcoming bills, medical bills, debt payments or consolidation, home
						renovation, and the likes. They are different from installment loans because they are used to fund
						specific personal expenses.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Peer-to-Peer lending</strong></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Peer-to-Peer lending or P2P lets individuals loan from other individuals. This cuts out the middleman
						which is the financial institution. It is also known as crowd lending or social lending. There are P2P
						websites like Prosper, Lending Club, and Upstart that connect individuals directly to people who are
						willing to invest and lend their money.</p>
					<p>The problem with these alternatives is time. It may take a while to be approved for installment loans,
						personal loans, and P2P lending</p>
