            <h1>Terms of Use</h1>

            <p>Accessing the PaydaySay website and/or app, you agree to be bound by these terms of use. Please read
                carefully. If you do not agree to these terms, leave the Website/App immediately.</p>
            <h3>How Loan Referral Service Works</h3>
            <p>PaydaySay is not a direct lender. It provides the loan referral service connecting the users with the
                prospective loan providers participating in the online network. Be sure to read our Privacy Policy
                before using the service.</p>
            <p>PaydaySay uses personal information to connect users with suitable lenders. Refrain from sharing your
                non-public data with third parties by checking the box in the application. PaydaySay doesn’t guarantee
                loan matches or amounts.</p>
            <p>Submitting the application the users may consent to receive recurring communications from PaydaySay, its
                affiliates, third-party marketers, and/or lenders, either by phone, text messages, autodialer, SMS, or
                prerecorded messages. The users’ consent to get recurring communications is not obligatory to use the
                services of PaydaySay. The users’ consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
            <p>Partner lenders that receive the user’s application assess the information in real time to define if it
                meets the underwriting criteria. Participating lenders may use the user’s information to conduct either
                a soft credit check, or a hard one, and review the information against national databases (including
                Teletrack) tracking customer transactions with lenders. Submitting the loan request, the user agrees to
                allow the lenders to assess, verify, and investigate the information in such a way.</p>
            <p>If the system defines the user’s application meets certain underwriting criteria, the user’s browser will
                be redirected to the lender’s website. You understand and agree that, once you have been redirected to
                the lender’s website, PaydaySay has no further involvement in the loan application or approval process.
                The users’ interactions with the direct lenders they are connected with are subject to the policies and
                terms enforced by that loan provider.</p>
            <h3>Accuracy</h3>
            <p>The PaydaySay users are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide through the
                application. PaydaySay may deny, suspend, or terminate the use of the service, in case the information
                turns out to be not accurate and truthful.</p>
            <h3>Control over Features, Functions, and Access to the Service</h3>
            <p>PaydaySay can make any changes to any functions, information, features of the service with no prior
                notice. PaydaySay can reject access to all or part of the service with no prior notice if the user
                engages in any activities that PaydaySay determines (in its sole discretion) as violative to these
                terms, the rights of the Website/App or any third party, or are otherwise inappropriate.</p>
            <p>PaydaySay takes no responsibility for any failures or delays in providing the service caused by errors in
                the application information provided by you or by any technical problems beyond its reasonable
                control.</p>
            <h3>Links to Third Parties</h3>
            <p>PaydaySay may contain links to other websites operated by third parties. These links are provided for
                your convenience and reference only. PaydaySay does not operate or control in any respect any
                information, software, products, or services available on such third party sites. The inclusion of a
                link to a website does not necessarily imply any endorsement of the services or the site, its contents,
                or its sponsoring organization.</p>
            <h3>Privacy Disclaimer</h3>
            <p>PaydaySay takes all the possible measures to protect the users’ information. The users agree that
                PaydaySay is not responsible if the user receives advertisements or notifications from lenders and other
                third parties that are connected to PaydaySay activity. The users allow sharing their information with
                the partner lenders. PaydaySay has no control over their use of personal information. The information
                provided by a consumer in the application is shared with one or more participating lenders.</p>
            <p>Use a separate email for business contact only to prevent spam and unnecessary contacts. Don’t use the
                company phone as third parties can send messages that do not comply with PaydaySay policy. Don’t list
                private or family email and avoid any information that can be abused by third parties.</p>
