            <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
            <p>Use of this App constitutes acknowledgement that You have read, understand, and are in agreement with
                this App’s Terms & Conditions. These Terms & Conditions apply to this App (also referred to as ‘App’).
                It notifies you (also ‘You’ and/ or ‘Your’) about the terms and conditions of our services. Please read
                these Terms & Conditions in full before using this App. If you do not agree with this App’s Terms &
                Conditions, do not continue to use this App or seek its services.</p>
            <h3>Services</h3>
            <p>The App is not a lender and does not broker loans. This App seeks to pair You with prospective lenders
                and does not guarantee that You will be offered a cash advance. We also do not guarantee the amount of
                your cash advance. The information from your request form may be shared with more than one lender.</p>
            <p>Your use of this App’s services includes providing relevant and necessary information which may include,
                but is not limited to your name, date of birth, telephone number, physical address, Social Security
                number, driver’s license number and state, email address, employment information, active military
                information, information about home ownership, citizenship status, frequency and amount of paychecks,
                and information about your banking account. This information will be used to pair you with cash advances
                and loan products. Submitting your information to this App also means You are allowing this App and
                third party lenders to contact You about loans and related products and services.</p>
            <p>Once your information is submitted, it will be reviewed by third party lenders who will then determine if
                You meet their requirements for a loan. These lenders may seek to verify your identity and may perform a
                credit check through a credit bureau. Submission of your information constitutes an agreement for your
                information to be used in these ways. If You are found to be eligible for a cash advance, You will be
                redirected to a new page with the lender’s information or redirected to the third party source.</p>
            <p>This App cannot guarantee that the loan offers that You will receive are the best available. Also, this
                App cannot guarantee the product, price, rates, fees, availability or any other terms of a third party’s
                loan products and services. This App is not involved with an agreement you may enter into with a third
                party lender. Your interactions with your lender are governed by their Privacy Policy, terms,
                conditions, and other policies. Questions, issues, and problems regarding your loan agreement should be
                directed to your lender, and not to this App.</p>
