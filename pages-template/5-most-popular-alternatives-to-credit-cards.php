                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Needless to say that a credit card is one of the most popular credit
                        products. It does not give the feeling of giving away your money to some stranger. You simply
                        swipe it and buy whatever you need. However, there are cases when you can’t get an unsecured
                        one.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you can’t get approved for an unsecured credit card, you should
                        know that there are other good options available for you. Let’s take a look at popular
                        alternatives to credit cards.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Also, we will find out more about the pros and cons right now. Get a

                    <h2>1. Debit Cards</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">A debit card gives you an opportunity to make purchases with the
                        money from your bank account. In other words, you just use the money you really owe without
                        getting in debt.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">But debit cards are less protected from fraudulent activities than
                        credit cards. If someone stoles the money from your debit account, you should report it within 2
                        months after getting a statement because if you don’t, you&#8217;ll hardly get it back. Also,
                        you can face a problem trying to rent a car or book a hotel room with your debit card.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">But using a credit card gives you many temptations and takes away
                        the pain from spending your own money so you can easily exceed your budget. That&#8217;s why a
                        debit card is a good choice for you if you want to stay on a budget and avoid extra
                        spending<strong>.</strong></p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">2. Installment Loans</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">With a credit card, it&#8217;s comfortable to make daily purchases
                        but unexpected life events may require a different solution.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you need to get some urgent money, you can apply for <a
                                href="/unsecured-personal-loans/">unsecured personal loans</a> and get funds for any
                        needs. You’ll get the money directly to your bank account and it’s not going to be long-term
                        debt. Unsecured loans are intended to help you deal with financial emergencies and one of the
                        main benefits is that you can repay your <a href="/small-personal-loans/">small personal
                            loan</a> by making convenient installment payments.</p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">3. Prepaid Debit Cards</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you like mobile banking and paying bills online then a prepaid
                        debit card can suit you well. You just put the money on your card and use it for different
                        needs.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">However, there are different kinds of fees usually attached to
                        prepaid debit cards. For example, there can be transaction, service, ATM and regular monthly
                        fee. Before getting a prepaid debit card, read its terms and conditions carefully to avoid
                        unpleasant surprises in the future.</p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">4. Secured Credit Cards</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">There can be occasions when 0% unsecured credit card is not the best
                        choice. Also, as we said earlier, not all the consumers are eligible for unsecured ones. If
                        you’re one of them, consider getting a secured credit card.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The thing is you should put a security deposit to get one. Usually,
                        these cards have a credit limit equal to your deposit, so if you put $300 you get a $300 credit
                        limit.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">One of the main benefits is you can build your credit using such a
                        plastic. However, there are fees you have to pay: annual, monthly maintenance and application
                        one. Also, secured credit cards usually have higher interest rates than unsecured ones.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Alternatives to Credit Cards</h3>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Using cash only is the best choice if you want to avoid
                            debt </strong>and not to be afraid to spend more than you have. So, the best alternative is:</p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">5. Cash</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Carrying a lot of cash is not always comfortable. But if you pay
                        with cash, it’s easier to live within your means because you can’t spend more than you have. As
                        a nice bonus, you will not have to deal with debt collectors!</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Credit cards often make people buy things they can’t afford and
                        become a reason for getting into the debt burden. On the other hand, the money you have on a
                        credit card are protected from fraud or steal in a certain way while you can easily get your
                        cash lost or stolen.</p>
