                        <p>Why should you wait to satisfy your wishes or to cover your needs? Modern life can be really
                            unpredictable. We all may experience spontaneous desires or temporary monetary issues once
                            in a while when we consider various lending options and think &#8220;<em>Probably, I need a
                                loan now</em>&#8220;.</p>

                            <i>&#8220;Money is a guarantee that we may have what we want in the future. Though we need
                                nothing at the moment it insures the possibility of satisfying a new desire when it
                                arises.&#8221;</i> &#8211; Aristotle</p>
                        <p>The lending industry is rapidly growing over the last few years due to its accessibility.
                            More and more people are choosing small loans to cover different types of expenses.<br/>

                        <p>The total personal debt for American citizens is currently $143 billion, according to the <a
                                    href="https://www.chamberofcommerce.org/personal-loan-statistics"
                                    target="_blank">Chamber of Commerce</a>. So, here are the main reasons why consumers
                            need loans.</p>
                        <h2>Why People Choose Personal Loans?</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="color: #084c8d;"><em>&#8220;I need a loan now please help!&#8221;</em></span></strong>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Many people face temporary financial difficulties because of the world economic crisis. Some
                            of them can’t afford expensive purchases or live paycheck to paycheck while urgent
                            unexpected bills can easily unsettle them and knock them off the wagon. So, consumers decide
                            that they need an emergency loan to help them stay
                            financially secure.</p>
                        <p>All the people who need loans now may turn to their local banks, credit unions, or
                            peer-to-peer lenders. Every lending institution has its own advantages and drawbacks.
                            Depending on your current financial needs and credit history, you may need to opt for a
                            certain finance-related service provider.</p>
                        <p>For instance, a traditional bank prefers to deal with consumers who have a good credit
                            history.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li style="text-align: left;"><em><span style="color: #084c8d;"><strong>&#8220;What if I need a loan but I have bad credit?&#8221;</strong> </span></em>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You should save your time and apply to online lenders instead. PayDay Say can facilitate this
                            process for you and help to obtain the necessary funds even when you need a loan with bad
                            credit.</p>
                        <p align="center"><a class="goto-btn" style="width: 186px; line-height: 49px; font-size: 18px;"

                        <p>Here are the top 8 reasons to take out a personal loan:</p>
                        <h3>1. Consolidate the Debt</h3>
                        <p>Some people have several high-interest debts which turn out to be even more difficult to pay
                            off.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #084c8d;"><em><strong>&#8220;What can I do if I need a loan but keep getting declined?&#8221;</strong></em></span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>One of the best reasons is to use a small personal loan as a way to <a
                                    href="/debt-consolidation-loans/">consolidate debts</a> and turning them into one
                            single loan. This is a smart technique that can allow making only one payment on a monthly
                            basis instead of multiple payments that can easily be forgotten or missed.</p>
                        <p>Do you need a loan been refused everywhere? It is possible to qualify for a lower interest
                            rate that will also save your cash.</p>
                        <p><a href="/debt-consolidation-loans/"><img title="bad credit debt consolidation"
                                                                       alt="debt consolidation" width="640" height="222"
                                                                       src="<?= get_template_directory_uri() . '/assets/img/debts_banner_compr.jpg'?>"></a></p>
                        <h3>2. Combine Credit Card Balances</h3>
                        <p>The same way consumers may consolidate their credit cards. You may need a loan asap so that
                            the extra money is deposited to your bank account and you can use it to pay down the
                            balances on all of your credit cards. After that, you will have to repay just one loan
                            instead of multiple cards each month.</p>
                        <p style="border-left: 7px solid #5cbb16; text-align: left; padding-left: 10px; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic;">
                            &#8220;If you need a loan urgently but have poor credit, you should pay down balances on
                            your credit cards. This is the best action consumers can take to eliminate the risk of being
                            rejected again.&#8221; &#8211; Jennifer White, a consumer education specialist at
                            Experian</p>
                        <p>Consolidating your credit cards is a great option. It can help you reduce the interest rate
                            and boost the credit score.</p>
                        <h3>3. Purchase a Car</h3>
                        <p>One of the best reasons for a personal loan is making an expensive purchase that you can’t
                            afford if you live paycheck to paycheck.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #084c8d;"><strong><em>&#8220;I need a loan today because I want to purchase a car.&#8221;</em></strong></span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It’s quite possible. You can finally allow yourself to buy an auto, a motorcycle, or a boat
                            if you want. This lending solution works best for the situations when you can’t qualify for
                            a secured loan with a lower interest rate.</p>
                        <h3>4. Pay Wedding Expenses</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://www.brides.com/american-wedding-study-5079338" target="_blank">The
                                    average wedding cost was about $28,964 in 2020</a>.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>More and more couples desperately need a loan fast to finance the dream wedding. There is no
                            doubt that every person wants to turn this special occasion into the best day of their life.
                            Thus, the expenses may be much higher than you’ve planned.</p>
                        <p>If you can’t afford to pay for the venue of your dream or a brand new fashionable bride’s
                            dress, one of the good reasons for personal loans is to take it for funding this special
                            day. The money can also be spent on the photographer, the wedding coordinator, or the
                            beautiful venue.</p>
                        <p>Some people also need a small loan to purchase the engagement ring. As you can see, this
                            quick cash can cover any expenses connected with the wedding.</p>
                        <h3>5. Pay for a Vacation</h3>
                        <p>Have you been dreaming about a perfect honeymoon getaway? Are you willing to go on a
                            long-awaited cruise on your vacation? Do you need a $5,000 loan with bad credit?</p>
                        <p>Don’t postpone making your dreams come true. While traditional banks may refuse your
                            application, many online lenders will agree to cooperate with borrowers who need a loan
                            desperately because they would like to go on a vacation.</p>
                        <img alt="need a loan" width="640" height="410" src="<?= get_template_directory_uri() . '/assets/img/reasons-for-loans.jpg'?>">
                        <figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Photo credit: Unsplash.com</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>You may use the money to buy flight tickets, book a hotel, finance your food or
                            entertainment, etc.</p>
                        <h3>6. Unforeseen Urgent Expenses</h3>
                        <p>Nobody likes to talk about such problems, but this is life and it’s certainly
                            unpredictable.</p>
                        <p>You can’t always be ready for various unpredictable expenses and have enough money in
                            savings. There are some situations in life when you may need a <a
                                    href="/100-dollar-loan/">100 dollar loan</a> now and you can’t wait.</p>
                        <p>For instance, short term loans are a great way to fund funeral costs as this ceremony is
                            usually very pricey. Funeral expenses cost a lot, so if a deceased person hasn’t saved
                            enough, his or her family members may opt for this lending solution to finance the
                            ceremony.</p>
                        <p>Another significant reason for a loan is to cover urgent medical bills. You may need a loan
                            today because you can’t wait until the next payday. Various treatments including cosmetic
                            surgeries, dental procedures, or fertility treatments can be really expensive.</p>
                        <p>Do you need a 500 dollar loan to pay off the bills? All the costs connected with medical
                            services and aftercare may be easily covered.</p>

                            need a quick loan for any type of home remodeling, you can apply for this lending solution

                            <li><strong>Do you need a loan with no credit check? Pay attention to the terms and
                                    conditions as every creditor will still perform at least a soft credit check to
                                    avoid risks.</strong></li>

                        <h3>8. Moving Costs</h3>
                        <p>While you may need money now, loans for moving are also extremely popular among people these
                            days. When you are willing to relocate to another city or even state, then you may need
                            loans today to support you moving and help it go more smoothly. You may use the money to
                            cover expenses connected with furniture, moving your personal belongings, transportation,
                            rent, etc.</p>
                        <p>If you are moving and need a loan with poor credit, make sure your new income will be enough
                            to repay the debt.</p>

                            conditions and read the fine print to understand all the extra fees.</p>
