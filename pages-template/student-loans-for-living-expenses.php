                    <p>As a rule, the story starts with how excited they are to get into a college. In the end, a
                        remarkable number of them had to resort to loans for school to pay for the college.</p>
                    <p>With 20 million people that attend college in the United States, about 60% <a
                                href="/best-ways-to-borrow-money/">borrow money</a> to help pay the tab, according to the
                        Chronicle of Higher Education.</p>
                    <p>Say, you are a first-year student and wonder, ‘How much student loan can I get?’, find out the
                        amount of your loan for school right now.</p>
                    <p><span id="more-10317"></span></p>
                    <h2>Student Loans Limit</h2>
                    <p>So, as a matter of fact, government school loans should be your first choice when considering
                        your borrowing options for paying the tab. But, unfortunately, they are not available for
                        international students. Though, you may research the Internet and find good companies offering
                        student loans for international students.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, the amount of government student loan depends on your year in school, your status as a
                        dependent or independent student, and the type of loan for sure. With this in mind, if you’re an
                        undergraduate expect to get up to $12,500 annually and $57,500 total, while graduate students
                        have a chance to get up to $20,500 annually and $138,500 total.</p>
                    <p>Yet, in case the government loans don’t cover a student’s full financial need, private loans can
                        come into play. To make things clear, with 45 million people in the US carrying student debt,
                        private lenders currently hold less than 10%.</p>
                    <p>It’s not always the case though they typically offer higher borrowing limits than the government
                        loans. Yet, the amount you borrow can’t exceed your school total cost of attendance.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <h3><em>if you’re an undergraduate expect to get up to $12,500 annually and <span
                                        style="color: #008000;">$57,500 total</span>, while graduate students have a
                                chance
                                to get up to $20,500 annually and <span style="color: #008000;">$138,500
                                    total</span>.</em></h3>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>When selecting a lender, it’s important to review the terms or contact the lender directly with
                        your questions. Besides, every lender’s range varies, so it makes sense to explore the interest
                        rate and repayment terms.</p>
                    <h3>How to Get Loans for College?</h3>
                    <p>Once you determined to <a href="/">get loans</a> for college, learn all
                        borrowing options you have. Do not forget, with both government and private student loans, you
                        will have to pay back the money you borrow plus interest.</p>
                    <p>Before you get started, make sure you compile the necessary financial information:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>documentation;</li>
                        <li>your income;</li>
                        <li>credit history;</li>
                        <li>necessary eligibility factors.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This process takes time. Once you’re approved for a school loan, check whether the lenders’
                        offerings match your requirements.</p>
                    <p>Keep in mind that each student has unique funding needs. So, no single lender can be all things
                        to all students. Remember that each lender is different when it comes to your student loans.</p>
                    <p>Some lenders might send your loan money directly to the school and then only the latter sends you
                        a check. While others might send the loan money directly to you. So, make sure you know where
                        your money is going.</p>
                    <p>Anyway, once you apply for a student loan, the loan amount might exceed your expectations to
                        cover your expenses. Yet, you might not accept the entire loan offered and can simply request a
                        lower needed amount. The truth is that no matter how good the terms for a loan are, it’s always
                        cheaper to not borrow money in the first place.</p>
                    <h3>What Can Student Loans Be Used for?</h3>
                    <p>With the loan money in your bank account, it can be rather tempting to squander the money on
                        other things, like a shopping spree. Indeed, you’ve heard stories about students who have
                        frittered away their student loans on impulse buys like trips, smartphones or stereos. They have
                        no idea how to pay this back.</p>
                    <p>Before you even think about it, think carefully about how long it will take you to repay that
                        money. Think of the main squander – <strong>YOU</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Take care of poor spending habits which can hurt your bottom line. No matter what your interests
                        are, try to avoid <a href="/emergency-car-repair-loans/">paying for car repairing</a>,
                        travel, clothes, eating out or down payments that do not relate to your education.</p>
                    <p>So, it makes sense to keep your student loan money in a separate bank account with no immediate
                        access. Remember that the more you use your student loan for non-education expenses, the longer
                        you’ll be paying them back. With the main goal to help pay the tab, use them as little as
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>If spent unwisely, chances are you’ll be kicking yourself for years after graduation when you
                        have to pay that money back plus interest.</p>
                    <h3>Can I Spend Student Loans for Living Expenses?</h3>
                    <p>Face it, if you want to apply for a student loan, it makes sense to understand what the money
                        covers and how payments are made. The truth is that student loans cover not only the cost of
                        college but also other expenses directly associated with college attendance. It includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>activity fees;</li>
                        <li>room and board;</li>
                        <li>library fees;</li>
                        <li>parking permits;</li>
                        <li>other fees covering the use of on-campus technology.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It’s important to consider all options, especially when it comes to student loans for housing.
                        You may wonder ‘Does financial aid pay off-campus housing?’</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <h3><em><strong>The average student housing costs may vary from $9,988 at Florida State
                                    University up to $15,951 at Harvard.</strong></em></h3>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Well, according to the <a href="https://www.ed.gov/" target="_blank">US Department of
                            Education</a>, the larger provider of grants for college students ensures that students may
                        use government aid funds to pay for their off-campus housing expenses.</p>
                    <p>It’s better if you know ahead of time that you plan on living off-campus. Make sure you include
                        this on your student aid form, as students who live off-campus tend to receive slightly more
                        financial aid.</p>
                    <p>In cases where you risk losing your housing or struggling to pay the bills, you are far from
                        alone. As <a
                                href="https://www.cornerstone.edu/graduate/costs-aid/"
                                target="_blank">college costs</a> continue to rise, a particular number of organizations
                        and
                        programs can give students a helping hand. Consider applying for different programs that help
                        pay rent for college students to keep your head above water.</p>
                    <p>Well, using too much of your student loans for housing and living expenses could leave you short
                        for the tuition bill.</p>
                    <p>Do yourself a favor, take advantage of grants for living expenses while in college. Indeed, it’s
                        not a piece of cake, yet it’s a safe bet for needy college students. Don’t shy away from grants
                        and scholarships. As simple as it sounds, the money you earn does not require repayment.</p>
                    <p>Of course, it makes sense to find ways to save with more affordable housing options. While when
                        used responsibly, student loans can help make a successful investment in your future. And
                        remember that you can begin returning your student loan debt when you&#8217;re still in college.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Spend Responsibly</h3>
                    <p>To top it all off, it’s in your interest to spend your loans for school wisely. Face it, the more
                        you sacrifice now, the better you’ll set yourself up for the future. Find your best loan for
                        school today.</p>
