					<h3>Surrogacy Financial Points to Consider</h3>
					<p>There are different financing methods for surrogacy other than loans. They all seem really
						cost-conscious
						if you get a chance.</p>
					<p>Among affordable surrogacy options are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A surrogacy agency financing plan;</li>
						<li>A grant from a state foundation;</li>
						<li>Borrowing from family and friends (some even ask a family member to carry a child for them);
						</li>
						<li>Withdrawing from 401(k) plan;</li>
						<li>Credit cards;</li>
						<li>Insurance.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Still surrogacy loans do have an edge on the variants above.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Private lenders make up loan plans to cover all expenses, not just agency and legal fees as with
							agency loans.
						</li>
						<li>Foundation grants also award $10000 at most.</li>
						<li>Only a few organizations provide insurance plans that cover surrogacy costs.</li>
						<li>Credit cards do offer a 0% introductory period, but it’s too short to repay the loan in full
							amount
							and you’ll end up with growing interest.
						</li>
						<li>Borrowing from friends and family can put you in an awkward position.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Plus, private creditors offer way more than surrogacy loans. They issue medical loans and <a
							title="Emergency Loans for Urgent Money Needs" href="/emergency-loans/">online emergency
							loans</a>
						to deal with any type of financial urgency.</p>
					<p>There are ways, though, to lower the cost of surrogacy expenses.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Try to locate a surrogate that lives in your area to save money on transportation. In this case,
							do
							not opt for an abroad surrogate either.
						</li>
						<li>Consult a lawyer early on to learn about your legal rights as future parents to avoid overpaying
							for
							legal services.
						</li>
						<li>Opt for SET (Single Embryo Transfer). This way the surrogate mother will likely have only one
							child
							and you won’t have to worry about mounting expenses for the baby.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Finally, people who appreciate convenience go with online lenders. You can get prequalified for a
						surrogacy loan, apply and receive the funds in one place and in just a day.</p>
