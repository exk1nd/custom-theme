                                rel="nofollow">29.6 million small businesses in the US</a>. The statistics shows that
                        about 69,4% (which is two-thirds) of such enterprises survive their second year in business.
                        That means that more than 20% of small businesses fail in their very first year.</p>
                    <p>It is hard to start your own business. But it is even more challenging to keep it going all the
                        time. How to guarantee the business growth, revitalize it and make sure that you will be one of
                        those who survived the 10th year in business (which is 32.8% of entrepreneurs by the way)? Reach
                        the following tips to breathe life back to it.</p>

                    <h2>Analyze the Current Situation</h2>
                    <p>Find some time to gaze into how your business works at every level. Check everything, including
                        the quality of the services or the products you are providing. Any small detail, like
                        time-management of the employees, can spoil a mechanism of the business growth. Check everything
                        to see what is working wrong and correct it.</p>
                    <p>You should especially pay attention to the marketing initiatives of your business. Which of them
                        increase the number of sales? It may be a problem if you can’t decide which strategy is
                        effective and which one is not. Target your marketing campaigns at the right clientele. <a

                    <h3>Ask for an Outside Assistance</h3>
                    <p>It is often quite helpful to turn to an outside organization. Sometimes a team does not notice a
                        problem, that a fresh look can recognize immediately. An outside expert can be more informed
                        about new technologies, marketing options, and other business growth strategies. Conducting an
                        extra research on your own is also helpful. But hiring a consultant and performing the business
                        activities on the new information is necessary, even if it will cost a dime.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.sbga.com/" rel="nofollow">Small Business Growth Alliance (SBGA)</a> is one
                        of such organization. It has almost two decades of experience in helping out businesses. This

                    <h3>Reevaluate Your Budget</h3>
                    <p>When the business needs revitalization, it is tempting to cut recurring expenses, like salaries
                        for the employees. But before making a cut it is vital to consider the value of each
                        expenditure, especially the ones touching human resources. Cuts on payroll can lead to hidden
                        costs, like damaging the morale of an employee and killing team spirit. You&#8217;ll be
                        surprised to learn how some people manage to run their business on $100 only!</p>

                    <h3>Make a Dramatic Change</h3>
                    <p>In some cases, a dramatic change is a key to the business revitalization. For example, the old
                        name of a brand does not say the client what it sells. Rebranding is the best step in such a
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps a new technology is a solution. Every option that is worth considering when it comes to
                        business revitalization. It means implementing changes, even if the team is not comfortable with
                        them. Developing plans and getting advice are good things, but they are useless until you turn
                        them into reality.</p>
                    <h3>Alternate the Business Model</h3>
                    <img title="business model" alt="Alternate the Business Model" 
                         src="<?= get_template_directory_uri() . '/assets/img/business-model-300x208.jpg'?>" class="wp-image-8459 size-medium lazyload">
                    <figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Photo credit: pexels.com</figcaption>
                    <p>An outdated business model can lead to bankruptcy in any business, that has been successfully
                        operating for a long time. Changing the business model is not a simple process, but it can save
                        your business from shutting down.</p>
                    <p>Alternating the business model does not equal changing products and services you offer. They can
                        be slightly modified, but the main focus should be put on changing your marketing, delivery and
                        pricing practices.</p>
                    <h3>Look for the Right People</h3>
                    <p>It is hard to keep the business afloat if people you work with do not share your vision. So stop
                        cooperating with people, whose aim differs from yours. Find the ones that will resurrect your
                        dying business as soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>If you are sure about every team member, make business revitalization their target. Get your team
                        together and inform them that it is time for changes. <strong>Get input from every team
                            member</strong>. Ask everyone individually if he/she has an idea about improving the
                        business performance.</p>
                    <h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
                    <p>There is no universal business strategy, that can revitalize business immediately. Reasons, like
                        failing to upgrade to newer technology or economic downturns, vary considerably but can affect
                        the bottom line of the company in the same way. You have to analyze what has led to the current
                        situation and to create a new plan.</p>
                    <p>The earlier you start business revitalization, the better. You can spend more resources and less
                        damage to repair. Keep a check on potential problems and solve them till you promote small
                        business growth or have a successful business.</p>
