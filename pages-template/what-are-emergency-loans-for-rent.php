				<h2 align="center">How Long Can You Go Without Rent Payment</h2>

				<p align="center"><i>A common question that usually arises is – how long can you go without paying rent
						before it’s evicted? Just because every state has its own eviction laws, it’s strongly
						recommended to understand what your rights are. As stated, if you don’t want your landlord to
						file for eviction, don’t ignore it.</i></p>
				<p align="center"><i>Receiving an eviction notice is no fun. Yet, even if you’ve got evicted, it’s not
						the end of the world. You can still move forward with emergency eviction loans. Before applying,
						it’s smart to go shopping for places that help you pay your rent. These could be online lenders,
						banks, or credit unions.</i></p>
				<p align="center"><i>Yet, since certain financial institutions take much attention to your credit score,
						online lenders might be your best bet. Different lenders have different guidelines for approval.
						Yet, most of them have more flexible lending terms when compared to traditional banks.</i></p>

				<h2>Where Can I Get Help to Pay My Rent</h2>

				<p>When you are facing an unsavory scenario, reliable online lenders need to be high on your list.
					Taking out even a small $100 loan for rent is easy but it’s not always obvious. First, make sure
					your score is in its tip-top shape.</p>

				<p>Have a less than ideal score? Your low-income level has no sight to increase? Well, not a win-win
					scenario, yet, that’s not the end of the game. One thing to consider here is that your options are
					limited.</p>

				<p>
				<blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #ccc; margin-left: 50px; padding-left: 10px;"><b>In general,
						loans for rent assistance vary from lender to lender. But typically, low-income limits and good
						credit scores are some of the key requirements to turn to emergency rent help.</blockquote>
				</b></p>
				<p>Now, what are your options if you have a less-than-desirable score or no credit history? While it may
					seem like big trouble, the reality is not all that awful. Yes, your options are more limited. Yet,
					there are still enough online lenders who offer rent loans for bad credit owners.</p>
