                </div>
                <div>

                    <p>PersonalLoan is an excellent solution for people who want to cover emergency expenses because the company sends money within 1 day. You may be asked for a lot of personal information to get an unsecured loan. This lender pays great attention to your income and debt to income ratio. Consequently, PersonalLoan offers loans for people with poor credit scores.</p>
                    <p>The loan amounts are flexible and vary from $1,000 to $35,000. PersonalLoan charges an average APR, which is between 5.99% and 35.99%. The repayment term may be from 3 to 72 months.</p>
                    <p>Unlike many other online lending companies, PersonalLoan services are available in all US states. This service provider is worth considering if you are looking for instant cash. However, if you need a greater amount of money, it is better to look for another company.</p>

                    <p>Thanks to Upstart, you can conduct a pre-qualification with a soft credit check and use an online calculator to predict the fee amount. You should remember that this lender provides only unsecured loan options. It also doesn’t allow you to take a co-borrower or co-signer. Consequently, Upstart may not be a good solution for people with harsh credit difficulties.</p>

                    <h3>LightStream</h3>

                    <p>Due to such appealing loan conditions, LightStream loan product may be used as a credit-building tool. However, this lender requires a long credit history from its customers.

                    <p>All in all, LightStream is a reliable lender with beneficial loan terms and requirements. But it is not for people with bad credit. To qualify for funds, your score must be good or fair.</p>

                    <h2>How to Get a Fast Cash Loan</h2>
                    <p>Before you start the process of searching for payday lenders, read the state law carefully. Some loan options may be restricted in your place of residence.</p>
                    <p>If you need quick loans, credit unions and bank institutions won’t be the best option. Luckily, online apps provide cash with instant and easy loan application approval. </p>
                    <p>Such platforms issue installment loans, vehicle title funds, payday loans, cash advances, etc. To sign a loan with the chosen lender, you must go through several fast but essential steps. Below we will consider them in detail so that you get the needed loan product without any challenges. </p>

                    <h3>Prepare All Needed Documentation</h3>
                    <p>Unlike bank loans, digital financial solutions don’t require loads of documents and especially paperwork. But it doesn’t mean that online lenders allow loans to all borrowers. </p>
                    <p>Before signing a loan agreement, a service provider will ask you for some information for identity verification.</p>
                    <p>So, to get a loan product from any online lender, you must provide the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Identity proof: you can use a copy of passport, driving license, social security card, or voter ID;</li>
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Address proof: the same documents or utility bill;</li>
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Banking information: bank statements, credit score, and history;</li>
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Proof of employment and income: the latest salary slips, paystubs, bank statements, and tax returns.</li>
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Loan providers say all rights reserved.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Note that some payday lenders may set additional requirements for accepting loan requests.</p>

                    <h3> Calculate Estimated Payments</h3>
                    <p>Remember that you must repay not only loan proceeds but also additional fees that may include interest rate, origination, and app membership fees. Moreover, if you violate loan repayment terms, you will also face additional penalties.</p>
                    <p>If you need quick cash, it is essential to define a loan amount that will help you cover financial issues and won’t result in huge debts.</p>
                    <p>Many online lenders provide loan calculators to predict the length, interest, and amount of your monthly loan payments. This feature can help you avoid high interest rates and unreasonable loan conditions.</p>

                    <h3>Compare Lenders</h3>
                    <p>An essential step is to find a reliable lender with favorable loan terms and conditions. Before sending a loan request, you should ensure you won’t become a victim of scammers.</p>
                    <p>It is essential to check the customer feedback and overall rating of the chosen lender. In case you face financial fraud, contact the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation to get legal advice.</p>
                    <p>You should also pay attention to the repayment terms, interest rates, payment options, and additional finance charges while looking for the best lender. Try to understand whether the online loan is a good decision for you. Maybe after such research, you will prefer a credit union or a bank loan.</p>

                    <h3>Pre-Qualify For The Loan</h3>
                    <p>As mentioned, people with bad credit scores can also qualify for payday loans and installment loans. Sometimes it is difficult to predict whether the chosen lender will approve your application.</p>
                    <p>What’s more, in most cases, we can’t know for sure what interest rates, repayment terms, and loan amount a company will offer to us. Borrowers get to know this information before signing loan agreements.</p>
                    <p>To avoid ambiguity, some online lending platforms provide pre-qualification features. It is when a company conducts a soft inquiry of the borrower’s credit report to check their creditworthiness. </p>
                    <p>This procedure does not include reporting to credit bureaus and won’t hurt your credit score.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Apply For the loan</h3>
                    <p>Now you are ready for the final step! To get the funds, you need to fill in a short loan request form and include the above-mentioned information there. This process usually takes no more than 5 minutes.</p>
                    <p>After that, you have to wait for an approval decision. </p>
                    <p>How fast can I get my loan request approved? - you may ask. This process is usually done within a few hours. If you don’t qualify for funds, you will also receive a notification. </p>
                    <p>After getting a favorable decision, you must sign a loan agreement. You will get the loan within 1-2 business days.</p>

                    <p>Debt can strain your credit score, as it does for many Americans.</p>

                    <p class="quotation"><i>Total household debt in the U.S. was $14.27 trillion in the second quarter

                    <p>You can, for example, pay for a car repair bill that can help you keep your reliable
                        transportation for going to work. Or, you can take a payday loan to pay for expenses like
                        medical costs, without putting them on a credit card, which can lower your credit score.</p>

                    <p>If you need personal loan fast with bad credit, you don’t have time to work on raising your credit score.

                    <p>Credit agencies don’t raise your credit score instantly. It takes time to pay down your debts,

                <p>When you need cash fast, you may not want lenders to run a full hard credit check. If you have a poor
                    credit history, you may be declined by lenders who do run hard credit checks.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, PayDaySay is here to help you find the right lender to offer quick cash payday loans with
                    no credit check and instant approval.</p>
                <p>That means, your personal credit score and credit history are not factored into the decision of
                    whether to give you a cash advance loan. So, you can get the fast help you need with a short-term
                    loan without a hard credit inquiry.</p>

                <p>Instead, with a no credit check loan, the lender reviews your income sources and your bank
                    information so you can more easily get a fast cash online loan. They may review other criteria as
                    well. Your credit score is not the determining factor like it is with traditional financial
                    institutions.</p>

                                    hundred dollars up to thousands of dollars. You apply for a loan by providing
                                    information about your income and checking account with a simple online application.
                                    You may need to provide personal information like an email address or phone
                                    number.</p>
                                <p>Once you are approved, you get the lump sum of money usually within 24 hours. The
                                    money is deposited right into your online checking account, so you can access it
                                    easily when you need it.</p>
                                <p>Many lenders use lending criteria that doesn’t include your credit score. These loans
                                    can be ideal for people with bad credit who need cash to get them through an
                                    emergency. With many lenders, there is no cost to request a cash loan.</p>
                                <p>A fast cash payday loan will use your next paycheck as collateral for you to pay back
                                    the loan. Then you repay the loans with interest when you get your next
                                    paycheck.</p>
                                <p>With a fast cash installment loan, you repay the amount you borrowed with smaller
                                    payments over time. Terms can vary from as little as few months to several years.
                                    Typically, fast cash loans have a shorter repayment period of several months. The
                                    amount you pay each month is the same, so you can easily fit a repayment plan into
                                    your budget.</p>
