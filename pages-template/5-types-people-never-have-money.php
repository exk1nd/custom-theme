                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Today, many people complain that they are broke and can’t make
                            ends meet. However, tough economic times are not the main reason for this. If we are broke
                            or financially successful, it mostly depends on our financial behavior, our habits and
                            decisions we make. It’s easy to blame outer factors but it’s necessary to have the courage
                            to admit the reality. Do you want to know how to always have money?</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">At least, it’s necessary to <strong>make wise decisions, live
                                frugally and build savings.</strong> Also, it’s important <strong>NOT TO BE</strong> one
                            of these types of people because they are always broke. Let’s figure out who they are and
                            how to avoid being one of them!</p>
                        <p><span id="more-2733"></span></p>
                        <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Type#1: People who are Never Alone</h2>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">There are people who always need a company. Moreover, they need
                            an example and like copying other people’s actions. For example, somebody buys a new
                            smartphone. People of this type think that they need to buy a new phone too because they are
                            not self-confident enough. It’s important to understand that <strong>copying somebody’s
                                actions costs money</strong> and it can make you broke. Whether it’s good or bad, new
                            purchases don’t make us any better. Also, those feeling uncomfortable without a company
                            often overspend while shopping with their friends or eating out a steak in a restaurant when
                            indeed they have a hamburger budget.</p>
                        <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Type#2: People Making Late Payments</h2>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">It’s easy to explain why people who lack punctuality never have
                            money. If you want to avoid additional fees and high interest rates on your loans, you must
                            always pay on time. For example, if you don’t pay your credit card’s interest on time, you
                            need to pay a higher rate then, don’t you? Also, if you miss a mortgage payment, you must
                            pay a penalty. In other words, <strong>missed and late payments always make you pay
                                more</strong>. Moreover, they harm your credit and people with low credit are rarely
                            offered good rates when it comes to <a href="/">getting loans</a>.</p>
                        <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Type#3: People with No Savings</h2>
                        <img title="no savings" alt="when you don't have money"  
                             src="<?= get_template_directory_uri() . '/assets/img/no-money-2070384_1280-220x136.jpg'?>">
                        <figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Picture source: pexels.com</figcaption>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">People who don’t have a savings account or an emergency fund are
                            very vulnerable in a financial sense. Any emergency or a need to make an unforeseen purchase
                            makes them borrow money and get into debt.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">That’s why it’s important to build savings and protect yourself
                            financially as much as possible. Check how to put more money into your emergency fund and
                            create a savings account. Yes, it’s better to save as much as possible but it also will be
                            good if you will start small. But make it a rule and remember that whatever happens, you
                            should add a definite amount of money to your savings each month.</p>
                        <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Type#4: People who Lack Ambitions</h2>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Needless to say, that ambitious people are always more
                            productive at work and as a result, they make more money. Those who woke up every morning
                            and rush to work they have a passion to, are more successful, motivated and financially
                            stable.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">They work not just because they have to but also they set goals
                            which they want to achieve. People who don’t set any goals and don’t care enough about their
                            job are often people living in debt. They don’t have enough ambitions and motivation, so
                            they aren’t productive enough and don’t make enough money. Review your attitude to your job,

                        <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Type#5: People without a Budget</h2>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Meeting a financially successful person who doesn’t have a
                            budget is almost impossible. Budgeting is a discipline. When you have it, you keep your
                            expenses over control and live within your means, you know that you can’t spend more than
                            you can’t afford. But if you don’t have discipline, your expenses exceed your income and you
                            live in debt. There’s a smart way to organize your spending – Dave Ramsey’s envelope system.
                            It’s simple and doesn’t require any special efforts, don’t hesitate to try it!</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Remember, it’s hard to have money when you don’t have a budget.
                            Motivate yourself, improve every day and never be one of these people!</p>
