                    <p>Unfortunately, we do not inherit a talent for managing money. Some people are more
                        organizationally and mathematically inclined and find their finance way easier, but the very
                        first concepts are not bestowed upon birth.</p>
                    <p>We are introduced to money concepts at school, and, hopefully, parents take care of their kids’
                        financial literacy as well. <span id="more-1364"></span></p>
                    <p>We are lucky to live in an era of technological advancement. So, teens and young adults have so
                        many benefits once they begin using all these devices. They can be money savvy and independent
                        relying on technology.</p>

                    <h3>2. Left to Spend</h3>
                    <p>This is a basic budgeting app that is very similar to Toshl Finance. It considered as the best
                        budget app for teens. It is not really as fancy as the rest of the budgeting apps for teens on
                        our list, however, you will find its simplicity very attractive. A user can easily establish his
                        spending limit and subtract different expenditures.</p>
                    <h3>3. Manilla</h3>

                        efficiency.</p>

                         src="<?= get_template_directory_uri() . '/assets/img/finance-apps-300x229.jpg'?>">
                    <figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Photo credit: Pixabay.com</figcaption>

                        out of the blue.</p>
                    <h3>6. Debt Payoff Planner</h3>
                    <p>It is one of the best budgeting apps for young adults. From the name of the app, it is obvious

                        by highest debt, interest or balance.</p>
                    <p>One more great feature of the app is that it can design a project of when the debt will be paid

                    <p>The most appealing aspect of Saving Spree is its subtle focus on risks and rewards all in the
