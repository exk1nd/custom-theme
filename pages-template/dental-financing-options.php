                        <p>We know visiting the dentist is not your dream but there are many situations when it is
                            necessary and inevitable. Apart from being unpleasant such visits are usually quite
                            expensive.</p>

                                Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality</a>, the costs for dental financing have
                            increased by 23% over the last ten years. The majority of medical plans don’t come with
                           insurance. That is why you need to think about stomatological financial assistance yourself.

                        <p>Here are the best ways to consider.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <h2><span style="color: #084c8d;">Use Payment Plans</span></h2>
                        <p>If your insurance doesn’t cover medical expenses, you may opt for special payment plans at the
                            dentist’s office. Such plans are great as they allow clients to repay the price in small
                            sums over a certain time.</p>
                        <p style="border-left: 7px solid #084c8d; ; text-align: left; padding-left: 18px; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 16px;">
                            <em>If you don’t have the full amount to pay for your procedures, the payment plan can be a
                                useful option as it comes with zero percent interest.</em></p>
                        <p>As a result, you will pay off the same amount in the end. The only drawback of this financial
                            assistance for dental work is that the office won’t report it to the credit bureaus which
                            may not be perfect for your credit score.</p>

                        <h3><span style="color: #084c8d;">Insurance Can Help with Dental Costs</span></h3>
                        <p>Medical insurance may not cover stomatological expenses or cover only certain “necessary” types of
                            assistance that differ in various providers. Some help may be considered as a
                            medical procedure and won’t be covered at all. </p>
                        <p>So, it pays to discuss this information with your insurance provider to check what type of
                            procedures are covered. This will give you a better understanding of whether insurance will
                            be a smart idea to help to pay for dental work.</p>
                        <p>
                            <a href="https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/leading-health-indicators/2020-lhi-topics/Oral-Health/data"
                               target="_blank"><img alt="help to pay for dental work" width="650" height="475"
                                                    src="<?= get_template_directory_uri() . '/assets/img/loan-for-dental-care/'?>"></a></a></p>
                        <p>Also, pay attention that a dental office within your network will differ from the office that
                            only takes your insurance. If they say they will take your insurance for stomatological care
                            financing, they will most likely file a claim for you. In case your insurance doesn’t
                            include financing for this work, you will have to pay for these expenses out of your
                            pocket.</p>
                        <p>In other words, if you select a dentist office out of your network, chances are that you will
                            have to pay more than financing companies. Opting for an in-network dentist will mean the
                            fees are negotiated in advance and the prices won’t increase as the biggest part of odontic
                            financial help will be covered by your insurance.</p>
                        <h3><span style="color: #084c8d;">Grants from the Government</span></h3>
                        <p>I need dental work but can’t afford it. We understand you. If you don’t want to take out a
                            loan for odontic work and are willing to explore alternative financing options, government
                            grants may be your solution. For instance, the <a
                                    href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/childrens-health-insurance-program-chip/"
                                    target="_blank">Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)</a> and <a
                                    href="https://www.medicaid.gov/" target="_blank">Medicaid</a> are government
                            programs aimed at offering financing for patients with children who can’t afford it.</p>
                        <p><img alt="how to pay for dental work" width="660" height="410"
                                src="<?= get_template_directory_uri() . '/assets/img/dental-financing-assistance/'?>"></p>
                        <p>A stomatological emergency can happen with everybody when you are least prepared for it and have no
                            money to solve the problem. In several states, even adults may qualify for such grants and
                            get help with medical bills from the government. Get in touch with authorities in your state
                            to find out the details of this program in your county.</p>
                        <h3><span style="color: #084c8d;">Negotiate Your Medical Bill</span></h3>
                        <p>Sometimes the prices may vary from one dental office to the other. In case you can’t afford
                            to pay all the costs at once and you are looking for other options to finance stomatological work,
                            you may try to negotiate. Do your homework and compare prices in various offices in your
                            area.</p>
                        <p>The <a href="https://www.fairhealthconsumer.org/" target="_blank">Fair Health Consumer
                                Database</a> can assist you and help to learn about current prices. If you are asked to
                            pay more than average, you have the right to reject before you sign any papers. Dental
                            financing starts with the negotiation or even asking for a discount if you have bad credit
                            and need several procedures.</p>
                        <h3><span style="color: #084c8d;">Tap Your Family and Friends</span></h3>
                        <p>I need a dentist and have no insurance. Sometimes you may have no insurance and need a tooth
                            pulled. What can be your options?</p>
                        <p>If loans don’t work for you, you may ask your friends or relatives to lend you some money.
                            Financial aid for odontic work can come from various sources. There is nothing wrong with
                            asking your family members to help you out in case of an emergency. Well, it may be quite
                            embarrassing and uncomfortable to beg for money but it’s worth trying.</p>
                        <h3><span style="color: #084c8d;">Dental Financing for Bad Credit</span></h3>
                        <p>I need major dental work but can’t afford it because I live from paycheck to paycheck. For
                            many people, regular credit for odontic work doesn’t work as their credit score isn’t good
                            enough to qualify. It is the situation when you don’t have any time to <a
                                    href="/how-to-increase-credit-score/">improve your credit</a>.</p>
                        <p style="border-left: 7px solid #5cbb15; ; text-align: left; padding-left: 18px; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 16px;">
                            <strong>Are you searching for dental loans for bad credit? It may be more challenging than
                                the rest options but there is nothing impossible.</strong></p>
                        <p>Keep in mind that credit cards and small personal loan providers will demand to check your
                            credit and may reject it if it is poor. So, you may either look for loans with bad credit or
                            opt for alternative solutions such as negotiating the costs with the dentist’s office. Not
                            many lenders are willing to give out bad credit dental loans as they present higher
                            risks.</p>
                        <h3><span style="color: #084c8d;">Medical Credit Card</span></h3>
                        <p>Have you looked through reviews? Still want to have more options on how to get teeth fixed
                            with no money? There is a special medical credit card such as <a
                                    href="https://www.carecredit.com/">CareCredit</a>. It works sometimes better than
                            loans for stomatological work with bad credit.</p>
                        <p>As long as the consumer repays the full balance on the card by the end of the scheduled term,
                            CareCredit works at 0% interest and allows them to take a minimum of $200. This is a
                            wonderful alternative to dental care loans.</p>
                        <h3><span style="color: #084c8d;">Line of Credit</span></h3>
                        <p>Similar to short-term loans for tooth care, a line of credit is mainly another way to
                            receive financial help. It allows consumers to get money in small lumps rather than taking
                            out a big sum at once. However, the advantage here is that the person will need to pay an
                            interest rate only on the amount they borrow. Some people use a line of credit or loans for
                            braces to fund procedures.</p>
                        <p>All in all, there are various financing options to help you cover medical bills even if you
                            still didn’t <a href="/best-credit-repair-companies/">repair your bad credit</a>. Use
