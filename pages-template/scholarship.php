                    It always felt right to help people. Not only we choose to help with everyday financial pitfalls
                    when you may need <a
                            href="/small-personal-loans/">small personal loans</a>, but we also feel like
                    helping students. The situation with student loans has been pretty tough. Not only it’s more
                    complicated to qualify for
                    the student loan, but it is also hard to pay it off.

                    Naturally, future college and university students start looking for <strong>scholarship
                        money</strong>. There are so
                    many brands that help students. Among them are the Coca-Cola scholarship, Burger King scholarship
                    and others. Now it is
                    time for PayDay Say to step up and establish a scholarship fund.

                    Twice a year we hold the competition to support people who pursue education and you can get a chance
                    too!
