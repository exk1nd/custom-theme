                    <p>If you ask this question, you have more likely faced tempting advertising that promises to issue
                        a loan even if you have bad credit, an awful credit history, and a couple of debts to boot.
                        Still, before applying for these “beneficial” offers, you should understand if they are worth
                        considering.</p>
                    <p><strong>There is no lender, who will promise mortgage loans bad credit guaranteed
                            approval</strong>, just because of their good mood or kind personality. There is always a
                        list of requirements, limitations, and conditions that make a mortgage the worst thing ever for
                        you.</p>
                    <p>So, you can find mortgage loans for bad credit guaranteed approval but, in reality, they contain
                        such additional conditions that make them non-beneficial as:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;">Extremely high interest rate</li>
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;">Higher <a
                                    href="https://time.com/nextadvisor/mortgages/what-to-know-about-down-payments/"
                                    target="_blank" rel="noopener">down payment</a> costs
                        </li>
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;">Substantial collateral</li>
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;">Co-signer is an imperative</li>
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;">Inflexible loan term.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Anyway, even if the lender offers a bad credit mortgage loan, he needs some guarantees that he
                        won’t lose his money. Even if you aren’t able to pay off the debt, you will provide the payment
                        in another way. That’s what your lender wants to know.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, you should be very careful with bad credit mortgage loans guaranteed approval. They
                        often come along with unpleasant surprises that ruin your credit history, your budget, and your
                        dreams.</p>
                    <p>You should know the person you apply for a loan. The best idea is to get help from the lender,
                        who has already cooperated with your friends or family members. Plus, you should read forums to
                        find the feedback from real clients and reviews to hear the reputable opinion.</p>
                    <p>By the way, if you are looking for bad credit mortgage loans with possibly guaranteed approval in
                        Mississippi, you should better check out the list of reliable lending institutions.</p>
