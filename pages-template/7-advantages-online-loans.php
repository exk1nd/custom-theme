                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Historically, if you needed a car loan, home improvement loan or a
                        way to consolidate credit cards, you put on your nicest suit and headed down to the local bank
                        to request money. Luckily, the Internet has made this process much easier.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Online personal loans are readily available to eliminate the hassle
                        of applying for a loan and you can apply in your pajamas. Also, there are many sites that offer
                        such loan decisions that have further changed the lending and borrowing system.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The popularity of online loans is rapidly increasing with <a

                    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Why People Choose Online Personal Loans?</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Logic would dictate that borrowers be more inclined to trust banks
                        as opposed to online lending services. However, this is not the case. Therefore, why are so many
                        people placing their trust in online loans? Well, there are seven specific reasons:</p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Perfect for Emergencies</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most people try to plan their expenses but there are things it’s
                        impossible to foresee. Sometimes consumers need to borrow money really quickly and they can’t
                        wait until one of the traditional loan lenders approves their loan application. Online loans
                        perfectly suit for financial emergencies because getting them may take less than an hour.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Another important point is that you don’t have to explain why you
                        need the money so you can just use it the way you want.</p>
                    <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Convenience</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">One of the greatest factors for selecting an online personal loan
                        over a traditional loan is convenience. The process is as simple as applying for money
                        from the comfort of your home by filling out an online form and being quickly approved. All
                        dealings with the lender occur online so you do not need to make multiple trips to the bank to
                        discuss the loan with an employee.</p>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Easier Access</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">With the global economic downtown, banks have become considerably
                        picky with regards to lending. Online loan services are not as picky thus allowing you to get
                        approved for a loan easier, given the right credit score. You can get a loan even if you have a
                        low credit score or have no credit history at all. That’s the reason why online lending is so
                        much in demand.</p>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Lower Rates</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">In most states, payday lenders can charge only certain interest
                        rates. This industry is strictly regulated and sometimes an amount of loan applications is
                        limited. Such things intended to protect consumers from misusing personal loans. Reputable
                        lenders provide all the important information concerning a loan you’re going to take out so you
                        know exactly the cost of the loan and the interest charged.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, the majority of them are unsecured so no
                        collateral is required to be approved for the loan. Depending on the situation, this can mean
                        higher interest rates due to the higher risk taken by the lender.</p>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Numerous Options</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">There are many websites offering <a
                                href="/unsecured-personal-loans/">unsecured personal loans</a> so consumers have an
                        impressive choice. Before making a decision to apply to one or another loan provider you can
                        shop around and compare interest rates charged by different lenders but don’t forget that it’s
                        worth dealing only with trustworthy ones.</p>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Round-the-Clock Service</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes a money need comes at a non-convenient time, for example,
                        late at night when traditional financial institutions are closed. You don’t have to wait until
                        its open because you can get an online loan any time you need it. And there is no need to go
                        somewhere because a laptop and Internet access is all you need to fill a loan application.</p>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Saves Time</h4>
                    <img title="loan to save time" alt="online loans save time" width="300" height="200"
                         src="<?= get_template_directory_uri() . '/assets/img/save-time-on-loans-300x200.jpg'?>" style="float: right;margin-left: 10px;">
                    <figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Photo credit: Pexels.com</figcaption>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Getting approved online is quick and easy. This saves a significant
                        amount of time and effort. Pre-approval typically takes a few minutes based on Internet
                        speeds.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, getting a traditional pre-approval could take an
                        entire day of driving between lenders and personally talking to each one which takes more
                        time.</p>
                    <p>Online personal loans provided by PayDay Say deliver no headaches, allow for many different
                        options for the borrower, save time and money, and are much more pleasant experience
                        overall.</p>
                    <p>When searching for a personal loan, it is always beneficial to consider all options to ensure you
                        get the best rate that fits your budget.</p>
