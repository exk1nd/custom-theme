                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Every one of us has a different story. Some people were born in
                        wealth while others come from low income and middle-class families. And it happens quite often
                        when people who were brought up in the middle class don’t reach any special success in life just
                        because they allow such thoughts to appear on their mind.</p>

                    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">“I’m too Young to Think of Retirement”</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Many people are happy to find their comfort zone so they spend the
                        whole life without changing a thing. Not taking care of your future is one of the worst possible
                        mistakes. Many people save some little money for retirement thinking that they will have a
                        better moment for building retirement savings. Don’t trick yourself. Most of such people have to
                        work in senior ages and some of them borrow money to stay afloat.</p>
                    <h3 style="text-align: justify;">“The More Hours I Work the More Money I Make”</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t let yourself think that making money is actually exchanging
                        your time for dollars. Only poor people think that they have to work more hours to get a bigger
                        salary. Learn to value your time and understand that you can just use it to make an idea which
                        will make you wealthier. <strong>You can for 12 hrs per day or just use your head to do
                            something better</strong>. You can build something that will bring you money. Just don’t set
                        any limits for yourself.</p>
                    <h3 style="text-align: justify;">“What I Have is Enough for Me. I Don&#8217;t Need More”</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Open your eyes and pay attention to the number of rich people and
                        big companies in the world. Do you really think that they would become so successful if they
                        would stop on their first million? The secret is simple: think big. Learn to want more than you
                        really need. Learn to be demanding to yourself and train yourself. Do 10 times more than you
                        think is okay.</p>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">“Rich People Have Bigger Problems”</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some people prefer to believe myths over admitting the truth. There
                        is a saying that big money comes with big problems but don’t let yourself to become one of those
                        lazy people thinking that laying down on a sofa is comfortable and safe. Understand that having
                        no money in your pockets is a problem which is bigger than wealth!</p>
                    <h3 style="text-align: justify;">“Without Having Money I can’t Make Money”</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Stop finding excuses for not making as much money as you want and
                        need for a successful life. Many entrepreneurs have started their careers when they had nothing.
                        They even had no opportunity to get small business loans. Remember that you can always change
                        the situation f you really want it. There are many great stories of famous business people who
                        can motivate and inspire you.</p>
                    <h3 style="text-align: justify;">“There’s Not Enough Money in the World for Everybody to be
                        Rich”</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Once again, stop thinking small. You can’t even imagine how much
                        money exists in the world in cash and on digital bank accounts. Don’t think that there’s not
                        enough of something so you can’t get it. You can always get your share and even more, it depends
                        on the goals you set and things you believe in.</p>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">“Saving Money will Make Me Rich”</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re frugal and manage your money wisely it’s good for your
                        personal finances. But there’s one important point – saving money will never make you rich by
                        itself only. Don’t think that all millionaires have so much money because they use secret ways
                        of saving it and count pennies in a grocery store. Don’t be lavish but stay generous and let
                        yourself to dream big.</p>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">“I can’t Buy Happiness”</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">It’s just another excuse for people who don’t want to make efforts
                        to become financially independent. People saying that money doesn’t buy happiness just don’t
                        know where to shop! Frankly speaking, money isn’t intended to make you happy. It’s intended to
                        give you freedom of being able to make a choice. When you’re poor you can’t choose because you
                        buy only what you can afford. Throw all the <a

                                rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">thoughts which don’t let you being financially
                            independent</a> out of your head.</p>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">“Being a Rich Person Doesn’t Mean Being a Good Person”</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Rich people have reasons for being complicated. But the way they
                        make in their life to achieve financial freedom s complicated. All the difficulties we face in
                        our life change us. So you can afford to be a little bit selfish or not as good as you would
                        like to be. Keep in mind that your wealth makes you independent so you can take care of yourself
                        and without making problems for others. Don’t create a prison in your mind, don’t set limits and
                        just follow your dreams.</p>
