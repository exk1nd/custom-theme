                <p><span id="more-11872"></span></p>
                <p>Here is how they work and everything you need to know about them.</p>
                <h2>What Is a Credit Bureau?</h2>
                <p>Let’s start with the basics and give the credit bureau definition.</p>
                <p>[quote]A federal credit bureau or a credit reporting agency is a company that gathers and maintains
                    your credit information and later resells it to creditors, consumers, and creditors in the form of a
                    credit report.[/quote]</p>
                <p>There are approximately 40 types of credit bureaus in the USA these days. However, only three of them
                    are the most popular and familiar among consumers. They are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#Experian">Experian</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#Equifax">Equifax</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#TransUnion">TransUnion</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Some smaller agencies can be helpful as well, but potential lenders and creditors will most likely
                    check your credit with one of these top CRAs.</p>
               
			  
                    <h3>How Does Annual Credit Report Request Form Look Like?</h3>

                        for free. For this purpose, they should visit AnuualCreditReport.com, fill in the credit report

                        fields with the information you know.</p>
                    <p>As it was mentioned before, there is nothing complicated in filling the form. Still, if you need
                        any annual credit report request form instructions, you can call the Central Source that
                        Congress and solve all problems there.</p>

			   <h3>How Credit Bureau Systems Collect Your Information</h3>
                <p>There are several sources that give information to credit bureau services.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data that is bought or gathered by the bureaus.</strong> In some cases, the CRAs will
                        specifically want to buy the information that is connected with bankruptcy records or government
                        tax liens. They will later use this data to generate your credit bureau report free.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data is reported to the CRAs by the lenders.</strong> Various lending institutions can
                        also report information about the customers and their accounts to the credit bureau phone
                        numbers. In this case, important information is reported by creditors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data that is shared among several CRAs.</strong> Of course, credit bureaus are
                        competitors and have their own sources of information. But often they have to share data with
                        one another in a certain situation. For instance, they are required to share the initial credit
                        bureau fraud alert with other CRAs.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Where Can You Get Your Free Credit Bureau Reports?</h3>
                <p>If you are willing to get your annual credit report for free, you may get the copy at
                    AnnualCreditReport.com. You can get free access to your report from the 3 top credit reporting
                    agencies running this website.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong><em>Pay attention that you can get free access only every 12 months. If you still need
                                more frequent copies, each of them will cost about $15. Sometimes it’s worth paying the
                                money to get a quicker dispute process.</em></strong></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The free report will take 45 days to give an answer to your credit bureau dispute process, whereas
                    prepaid services will cut it shorter to 30 days. There are two ways to obtain your credit report.
                    You may either order it at a particular CRA or order three reports at once to check if all of them
                    are accurate and contain the correct information.</p>
                <h3>The Big 3 CRAs</h3>
                <p>Here is some basic information about the three most popular and well-known credit reporting agencies.
                    We can’t tell you which credit bureau is most important as they all have their benefits. It’s up to
                    you which company to apply to and which services to use.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong id="Experian">Experian Credit Bureau</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>This CRA got started in London in 1827 when entrepreneurs decided to collect and share information
                    about customers who wouldn’t pay the bills. Subscribers will receive a free annual credit report and
                    a Credit Tracker. Check the credit bureau contact near you if you want to become their subscriber.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong id="Equifax">Equifax Credit Bureau</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is known since 1899. It is one of the three major agencies where you can order your credit report.
                    However, it suffered from a <a
                        href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2017/09/equifax-data-breach-what-do" rel="nofollow"
                        target="_blank">hack attack back in 2017</a> and the sensitive data of 143 million clients had a
                    data breach. Since that time, the company has made an online tool that helps to check if your
                    personal data remains secure. The main advantage of this agency is that it provides a free
                    VantageScore and FICO score to its customers as well as the protection of their identity from fraud
                    attacks.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong id="TransUnion">TransUnion Credit Bureau</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>This agency first started as a tank car business, transforming later into a credit bureau. You may
                    check this credit bureau addresses to place a freeze on your credit report in case of identity fraud
                    or data breach. After that, TransUnion will notify the other two major CRAs about this situation.
                </p>
                <h4>Credit Report May Contain Errors</h4>
                <p>The last but not least tip is to check and double-check the information on your annual free credit
                    reports.</p>
                <hr />
                <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>According to the Federal Trade Commission survey in 2013, one in
                        twenty consumers has an error in their credit report that may affect their credit score and make
                        it harder to <a title="get a small personal loan" href="/small-personal-loans/">get a
                            loan</a> in the future</strong>.</p>
                <hr />
                <p>Some personal details or your name can be similar to dozens of other consumers’ names, which may lead
                    to errors and inaccurate data on your report. Often lenders and creditors may use this incorrect
                    information before making their lending decisions rather than check the documents provided by
                    borrowers.</p>
                <p>All in all, here is everything you need to know about the major credit bureaus and how they work.
                    Bear in mind that these agencies just provide credit reports and important information to lenders
                    but don’t take part in the approval process. So, if you want to be sure that the lenders will
                    approve your loan request, it’s better to check your report for any errors.</p>
