                    <p style="text-align: justify;">We all <a href="/how-much-do-americans-spend/">earn and spend
                            money</a>, but we live in times when money isn’t necessarily paper. Many of us don’t carry
                        cash
                        anymore and in some situations it can cause difficulties. For example, your friend has paid for
                        your
                        dinner and now it’s time to pay him back but you can’t do it because all the money you have are
                        digital and you have it on plastic cards. However, it’s not the reason to continue carrying the
                        debt. Moreover, such small debts may have a very negative impact on your relationship with
                        friends
                        so it’s time to figure out <strong>how to send money to them with a help of mobile
                            apps!</strong>
                        With their help you can send money to anyone anytime and having no cash will not be a problem
                        anymore.</p>

                    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">PayPal</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Today’s mobile apps can do almost everything! They can even earn you
                        extra money! PayPal is one of the most popular apps for sending and receiving funds. You can use
                        the
                        website or an app and it’s easy!</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Advantages:</strong> Through PayPal you can easily make
                        anonymous Internet payments and it’s very secure. People don’t have to provide a check or a
                        credit
                        card and it’s an International service.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> PayPal isn’t really a popular
                        service
                        for paying friends back but now you try a new feature called <a href="https://www.paypal.me/"
                                                                                        rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PayPal.me</a>.
                        Each user can get his own URL and send it to the
                        other person together with the amount and this person can complete the transaction and get paid.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fees:</strong> It’s free for everyone except merchants. If
                        you
                        make a payment with a credit card then you’ll be charged 2.9% + $0.30 per each transaction.</p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Venmo</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">You can easily send and request money with <a
                                href="https://venmo.com/"
                                rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Venmo</a>, just create an account and do a few clicks or
                        taps on
                        a phone screen. Most people prefer using the app but you can also complete transactions by
                        responding to the text notifications without even opening the app.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Advantages:</strong> It’s a very convenient service for
                        sending
                        money to friends. It’s easy to use on a regular basis.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Disadvantages: </strong>It’s better not use Venmo for
                        sending
                        money to those who you don’t know personally. Accept payments only from those who you know
                        wouldn’t
                        write you a bad check. The main disadvantage is that the app has certain security issues.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fees:</strong> It’s free if you use a bank account or one of
                        the
                        major debit cards. In case you use a credit card or non-major debit card, you are charged 3%
                        fee.
                    </p>

                        app or
                        Gmail (there’s a little icon with a dollar sign at the bottom of a message). If you have the
                        Google
                        Wallet Card, you can start spending money as only you received it and you don’t have to wait for
                        it
                        to be deposited to a debit card or a bank account.</p>

                        user-friendly app and it can’t be used at stores.</p>
