                    <p><b>The reason for that</b> is that the rules and regulations for payday loans like Speedy Cash
                        vary across the U.S. As a result, your state will determine what aid you’re allowed to
                        get. Thus, everything from the maximum loan amount, its fees and terms depends on
                        the state you live in.</p>

                            borrower who repays his loan early is penalty-free.</strong></p>

                        account. Just because of the higher interest rates through CashNetUSA, it’s always smart to
                        think on your feet.</p>

                                those who are in a tough financial situation to solve their short-term cash problems.
                            </p></b></blockquote>
                    </p>
                    <p>Unlike places like Speedy Cash that require a borrower to have a minimum credit score to apply
                        for a loan, CashAdvance.com claims no minimum score requirement, meaning that you can apply even
                        in case of bankruptcy. Face it, it could be a great option for some empty-handed borrowers.</p>
                    <p><i><b>The rates range from 15% to 1,564%. To find out the full cost of the loan you apply for,
                                consider Cash Advance terms of use and benefit from the cost estimator on the website.</i></b></p>

                    <p>When it comes to the loan amount you can borrow, the sum is not all that huge. That’s
                        anywhere from $200 to $10,000. The catch here is interest rates. In some cases, an interest rate
                        could be as high as the triple digits. The loan terms vary from lender to lender, yet, as a
                        rule, you have to repay the debt within one year.</p>

                    <h3 align="center">Ace Cash Express</h3>
                    <p>Ace Cash Express is worth considering if you are looking for quick and easy-to-get cash loans. This lender is suitable for people who need a small amount of money with a short repayment period.</p>
                    <p>You can apply for online payday loans or installment options. Co-signer applications are also accepted. The available loan amount varies from $100 to $2,000. To pay it back, customers may have no more than three months. </p>
                    <p>Ace Cash Express offers a quick loan approval procedure without checking your credit. You can receive funds directly into your bank account or pick up the money at a physical store. This lender allows you to change your loan decision within 72 hours after you apply for the money. It may be a beneficial feature if you are still hesitating. </p>
                    <p>Ace Cash Express offers fixed interest rate loans which means you can predict and plan your debt repayment. The APR varies from 91.52% to 630.13%, which is lower when compared with the majority of lenders in our list. What's more, the company may charge late and origination fees.</p>
                    <p>Remember that this lender is not for you if you need more than $2,000. Check the loan terms and conditions of your state since they vary considerably.</p>

                    <h3 align="center">Advance America</h3>
                    <p>If you want to get cash online but have poor credit, Advance America is worth considering. Like Speedy Cash, this company offers online and in-person lending solutions. Advance America has more than 1,400 physical locations in 29 states that provide instant financial assistance.</p>
                    <p>This lender offers payday loans, installment loans, car loans, and credit lines. With Advance America, you can get short-term loans online and receive the money within three business days.</p>
                    <p>The available loan amount starts at $100 and may be up to $5,000. This financial product provider doesn't charge a prepayment fee but sets relatively high interest rates. They depend on your chosen loan type and the state you live in. Usually, interest charges vary from 143.29% to 688.28%.</p>
                    <p>This lender can boast of an A+ BBB rating and loads of positive reviews from customers. It may be a good option if you want to get an online payday without credit checks and loads of documents. </p>
                    <p>To qualify for financial help, you must be 18 years old. The required documents are proof of citizenship or residence permit, driver's license (or passport), proof of income, and checking account data.</p>
                    <p>However, make sure you can repay your debt before signing a loan agreement. A short repayment period and high interest may become your financial burden.</p>

                    <h3 align="center">Check Into Cash</h3>
                    <p>With almost 30 years of experience, Check Into Cash can boast of an excellent reputation and millions of satisfied borrowers. This company offers short-term loans online until the next business day in 30 states. In 26 of them, there are Check Into Cash stores for in-person customer service.</p>
                    <p>This lender provides online payday loans, installment, title, and cash advance loans. Terms and conditions vary from state to state and depend on local laws. For example, people living in Mississippi can apply for a payday loan of up to $400, an installment loan of up to $2,000, and a title loan up to $2,500 online and offline. At the same time, in South Carolina, you can receive only a payday of up to $550 offline, while in New Mexico, none of these.</p>
                    <p>As to the loan amount, you can get up to $1,500 payday, up to $5,000 installment, and up to $25,000 title loans depending on the state. </p>
                    <p>Check Into Cash doesn't charge interest, but it has a service fee of $10-$30 per $100 borrowed. The average APR accounts for 400%. If you miss a due date, you may face a late payment fee between $25 and $30. For a 15-day delay in repayment, you will be charged an additional 5% of the loan amount.</p>
                    <p>Since the terms usually don't exceed 30 days, it may be challenging to repay the debt on time. If you have doubts, use the pre-qualification feature offered by Check Into Cash.</p>

                    <h3 align="center">Check' n Go</h3>
                    <p>Check 'n Go is another excellent alternative to Speedy Cash. Established in 1994 now, it can boast of nearly 1,000 physical stores. The company offers cash loans for people with poor credit and doesn't set minimum income eligibility requirements.</p>
                    <p>Check 'n Go provides payday, installments, cash advance loans, etc. If you need quick financial assistance, it is a great option for you since you will receive money the next business day.</p>
                    <p>A borrower can get up to $5,000 online or offline depending on a state and your credit record and history. The loan terms may vary, but they usually last from 3 to 18 months. For such an easy loan application process, you will be asked to pay a rather high APR ranging from 456.25% to 1520.83%. Check 'n Go may also charge additional fees, including late payments or origination fees.</p>
                    <p>To qualify for a loan, you must have an active checking account, be 18 years old, and be a US resident. Apart from this, you must include some other information, including your state ID license, passport, telephone number, banking details, etc.</p>
                    <p>Check 'n Go may be a great lending solution for people in need. However, this lender doesn't provide faxless loan applications, and its website may be difficult to navigate.</p>

                    <h2 align="center">Let’s Consider What Speedy Cash Is </h2>
                    <p>Speedy Cash is one of the most popular and reputable direct lenders in the USA. Established in 1997, it can boast more than 5 million clients. This platform provides four types of financial assistance,: payday loans, installment loans, title loans, and limits on credit cards.</p>
                    <p>Speedy Cash offers a fast and easy application procedure that may be done in multiple ways. You can apply for funds online, visit the nearest storefront location, or get money on special prepaid debit cards. However, note that fees may vary depending on a chosen option.</p>
                    <p>To qualify for loan products from Speedy Cash, you don't need to consider your credit rating because the company doesn't conduct a hard credit check. You can apply for a loan between $100 and $5,000 and repay it within 1 - 18 months.</p>
                    <p>The APR rates vary between 176.61% and 729.82%, which is rather high. The origination fee depends on state law and may vary.</p>
                    <p>All in all, Speedy Cash is a great option for borrowers with bad credit who need money instantly. But because of the high interest rate charged by this platform, you must be ready to pay back much more than you have borrowed.</p>
                    <hr/>
                    <h3>Is Speedy Cash Legit?</h3>
                    <p>Available in 29 states, Speedy Cash is a licensed lender, thus a legit option for people who are
                        strapped for cash.</p>
                    <p><i><b>Can you pay your loan back within the allotted time? The better for you and your
                                credit.</b></i></p>
                    <p>The key thing to remember is that this easy-to-approve option always goes hand in hand with the
                        risk of ending up paying for your debt because of high interest charges. Found a too-good-to-be-true option? Nothing’s free, so
                        is with taking a loan. So, think twice to understand all given information before you make a
                        pick.</p>

                    <h2>Why to Choose Alternatives To Speedy Cash?</h2>
                    <p>Speedy Cash seems like a great solution for credit borrowers with low ratings. However, you should remember that in some cases it is better to consider alternative lenders that provide loans like Speedy Cash. Why may you need to look for other payday lenders?</p>
                    <p>Firstly, the interest rate charged by this platform is rather high. Secondly, Speedy Cash may require an origination fee. Among other things, if you apply for installment loans, the company won’t report to consumer credit bureaus. Consequently, if you want to build credit, it is not an option for you.</p>
                    <p>However, if you look for places like Speedy Cash, check whether it meets your loan amount, repayment terms, and interest rate requirements. Choose a company that provides funds no later than the next business day and offers a convenient online application process.</p>
