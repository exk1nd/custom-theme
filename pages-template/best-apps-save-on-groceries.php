                    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Ibotta</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Today’s mobile apps make our life easier by letting us saving money,
                        making extra money and doing many other useful things. <strong>Ibotta</strong> is one of the
                        best apps, providing numerous <strong>cash back options</strong> at almost any store. In the
                        beginning, the app was focused on groceries but by now it has expanded to various areas of
                        commerce including alcohol, restaurants, electronics, home improvement and etc. To get cash back
                        from grocery purchases you have to tap on the offer, scan the product’s barcode, answer a quick
                        question and take a photo of your receipt.</p>

                        offering loyalty programs and makes earning rewards easier.</p>

                        groceries. You may check the app a few times a day to see the offers because they quickly

                        redemptions is reached. <strong>Groupon</strong> allows you getting cash back for your everyday

                    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Favado</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">This app doesn’t offer you cash backs on groceries but still, it’s
                        very practical. It shows you which products are on sale, which coupons are the best and tells
                        where you can find them. <strong>Favado</strong> is a very helpful app, especially for those who
                        clip coupons, but even if you don’t, you still can appraise <a

                                rel="noopener" target="_blank">money saving opportunities</a> it provides.</p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Receipt Hog</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Receipt Hog</strong> allows you taking photos of your
                        grocery receipts and getting cash backs. However, it’s worth noticing that it makes some things
                        more complicated. For example, one of the lacks is that the app pays you in coins which you then
                        have to redeem for cash so it can be difficult to define how much you’re saving. The app
                        collects data about consumer purchases and doesn’t encourage you buying specific items. Still,
                        you can save money with it!</p>
