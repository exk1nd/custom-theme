				<p>When a student or his family canâ€™t pay off a debt, they usually decide to write a debt settlement
                        private student loan letter. If this decision comes to your mind, it should be the last step in
                        your attempts to pay off the debt.</p>

                    <p>You should keep in mind that if you have enough money (sufficient income) to pay off the debt,
                        you will never qualify for private student loan debt settlement. But if you are in default on
                        your debt, then your lenders might consider your request.</p>
                    <p>Debt settlement for private student loan differs from the federal loan debt settlement. APRs
                        usually differ from lender to lender. Therefore, terms, conditions, and amounts of the
                        settlement also differ. Still, the settlement of private student loans is more flexible. For
                        instance, federal agencies usually require to pay off the whole sum in one lump during 90 days
                        after a settlement is approved. Private lenders might be more permissive.</p>

							<p>Debt management ratios measure someoneâ€™s financial condition. They show the ratio of a companyâ€™s
                        debt to its total financing. Usually, banks and other lending institutions turn to debt
                        management ratios analysis to estimate borrowerâ€™s creditworthiness and suitability for a loan.
                        It refers not only to large firms and to corporations. Lenders use debt management ratios when
                        they work with individuals also.</p>
						<p>Debt management ratios show the extent to which a firmâ€™s managers are attempting to magnify
                        returns on ownersâ€™ capital with financial leverage.</p>
						<p>Debt management ratios are a sort of indicator of the individualâ€™s financial health. The formula
                        for evaluating a debt management ratio looks like:</p>
						<p>It helps to show a number of companyâ€™s assets financed through debt. A higher value of a debt
                        ratio shows increased liquidity of the company. It means that a company manages to fulfill its
                        current obligations through its liquid assets.</p>
						<p>Still, each lender has its own guidelines when it comes to calculating the debt management ratio.
                        Certain factors affect the result: amount, a length of the repayment period, type of the loan
                        (secured or unsecured). Therefore, you should ask your lender about certain details
                        beforehand.</p>

                        software that helps to do it independently.</p>
						<p>Fortunately, many people can get out of debt independently. They only need a guide that would
                        help them to optimize data and brainstorm the most effective ways of recovery. Software for debt
                        management is a good guide.</p>
						<p>There are top three tools for debt management:</p>
						<ul>
                        <li><strong>Ready for Zero</strong> â€“ one of the simplest debt recovery management software that
                            creates a debt management plan after you link all your debt accounts. It tracks your
                            progress and provides two ways of recovery: the highest interest method first and the
                            encouragement of the debt snowball method. This is a sample of
                            debt-free management software.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>DebtQuencher</strong> â€“ provides a 3-steps plan to enter credit card balances, pick
                            a payment method, and follow the payment plan. This software is paid and will cost you $5
                            for one visit.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>DebtWise by Equifax</strong>. Nothing special â€“ software will develop a debt
                            management plan but with its help, you can automatically update your Equifax report. You
                            automatically get access to your credit score, credit report, and credit report simulator.
                            The price is $15 per month.

                                necessary to remain financially afloat, and repay the debt on time so that the credit
                                history doesnâ€™t get hurt.</p>

                                    unsecured loan, it may help you rebuild credit score and boost your credit

                                are more affordable. It happens because creditors face higher risks of default from
                                unsecured options. Not every lender wants to take such risks, so they have to put higher
                                rates.</p>
