                    <p>An FHA loan is a home loan insured by the <a
                                href="https://www.usa.gov/federal-agencies/federal-housing-administration"
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Housing Administration</a> and is provided by the
                        lender approved by the latter.</p>
                    <p><strong>The loans of such kind allow people with low income to <a

                        They are also popular due to small down payment requirements, you can get an FHA loan with as
                        small as 3,5% amount. By the way, you can check how to apply for an FHA home loan and decide
                        whether you are eligible.</p>
                    <p>Most FHA programs were initially sponsored by the government, but the main aim was to make them
                        self-supporting, based on insurance premiums paid by clients. To say it differently, in case a
                        borrower fails to pay back the mortgage, FHA will repay it to the lender.</p>
                    <p>When the client defaults on an FHA loan, the insurance premium is used to compensate for the
                        obligations. Due to the governmental guarantees, the lenders agree to provide large mortgage
                        loans and it makes it easier to buy a property.</p>
                    <p>Though FHA loans are not perfect, they definitely may become a nice fit in the situations, when
                        the borrower lacks means for 20% down payment and guarantees.</p>
