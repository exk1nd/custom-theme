            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>This Privacy Policy was updated: July 26, 2021.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy (also referred to as “Policy”) applies to the App (also referred to as “App”). It
                notifies you (also “You” and/ or “Your”) about our services, how we collect, use, and share Your
                information. Your use of this App and sharing Your personal information constitutes an agreement with
                these policies. Please read this Policy in full before using this App. Use of this App constitutes the
                acknowledgement that You have read, understood, and agreed to this Policy. If you are not in agreement
                with this App’s Policy and this App’s terms and conditions, do not use this App. Changes may be made to
                this Policy at any time.</p>
            <h3>Personal Information</h3>
            <p>By using this App and its services, you are allowing the App to collect “personally identifiable
                information” and “non-personally identifiable information” from You. These types of information are
                described below:</p>
            <h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
            <p>Use of this App requires You to provide certain “Personally Identifiable Information.” Your unique data
                allows for communication and identification. This information may include, but is not limited to your
                name, date of birth, telephone number, physical address, social security number, driver’s license number
                and state, email address, employment information, active military information, information about home
                ownership, citizenship status, frequency and amount of paychecks, and your banking information.</p>
            <h3>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
            <p>Use of this App provides us with anonymous “Non-Personally Identifiable Information” which may include,
                but is not limited to, Internet Protocol address, Internet Service Provider, operating system type, and
                browser type. This information may be obtained directly through the use of “cookies” – data sent to Your
                computer when visiting a web source. The disabling of cookies may prevent access to certain areas of
                this App. This App has no control over cookie technology. This information may be summarized and shared
                with third parties for the analysis of trends and statistics and is in no way linked to your Personally
                Identifiable Information.</p>
            <h3>How Information is Shared with Third Parties</h3>
            <p>Use of this App authorizes this App to share the information that you provide with third parties and
                affiliates. Sharing of Your information with this App gives us permission to share this information with
                our network of third party lenders. Third party lenders may use your information in one of several ways.
                It may be used to offer you a loan, offer other business services, or provide marketing information.
                Your information may also be shared with other third party list managers and marketers. These parties
                each have their own policies for collecting, using, and sharing your information. Once your information
                is shared, this App is no longer responsible for their handling of your information.</p>
            <p>The App reserves the right to share the information that you provide in response to a legal process, to
                prevent or remedy fraud, in the instance that this App is sold, acquired, or undergoes bankruptcy, to
                make improvements to this App, in the event that you violate our Policies and/ or Terms & Conditions, or
                when and where this App deems it to be necessary to protect this App’s rights and its assets.</p>
            <p>In addition, this App may allow advertisements from third party lenders and other advertising partners.
                These companies may employ their own technologies (including “cookies”) to track and collect information
                regarding their advertisements. This App does NOT provide personally identifiable information to these
                third party advertising partners.</p>
            <h3>How Information is Used</h3>
            <p>The information that You provide allows us to pair you with a participating third party lender in our
                network of lenders with whom we have a business relationship. This information also allows us to review
                or verify your request form, provide accurate customer service, communicate with you by mail, email,
                telephone, or mobile devices regarding our services (either our own or those of third parties), in the
                enforcement of our Policy and Terms & Conditions, or to do any other service described to you on this
                App. Your Social Security number and bank information may also be used to verify Your identity in order
                to protect against fraud.</p>
            <h3>How Information is Secured</h3>
            <p>This App uses a number of security measures to protect Your personal information from unauthorized
                retrieval, use, disclosure or destruction. This includes both digital and physical information. This App
                stores personal information on secure servers, and utilizes password protection.</p>
            <p>Although we take precautions to protect Your information, the storage or transmission of data cannot be
                guaranteed. As such, this App cannot guarantee your data, either in storage or in transmission.
                Accessing this App is done at Your own risk.</p>
            <p>If a security breach does occur which affects Your Personally Identifiable Information, you will be
                notified along with any responsible agencies as dictated by law. Notification may take place in the form
                of an email. This notification could be delayed by law enforcement in order to conduct an investigation
                and enact further security measures.</p>
            <h3>Links to Third Party Sources</h3>
            <p>This App may have links to third party sources that this App does not control and whose policies differ
                from those of this App. This App is not responsible for the practices, content, or policies of third
                party sources. By accessing third party sources, you are responsible for the information you provide as
                well as the content that you access. These sources may use your personal information differently than
                our use of the information that You submit to this App. Please read each source’s Policies and Terms &
                Conditions.</p>
            <h3>Push Notifications</h3>
            <p>If you provide your consent, we may send push notifications to your web browser or mobile device. Push
                notifications may include marketing messages from us or from third-parties. You can alter your push
                notification settings at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile device or
                browser.</p>
            <h3>Opt-In/Opt-Out of Communication</h3>
            <p>By submitting your information on this App, you are opting-in to receiving communication contact from the
                App and/or a trusted lender within our network of lenders. You may choose to “Opt Out” of sharing your
                personally identifiable information for certain purposes when it is requested on this App. When
                completing the registration process, indicate your preference on this App or by following a link
                provided in our email communications. This App, our affiliate(s) and/or third parties may also promote
                product and service offerings to you via e-mail, SMS (text) message, by telephone, auto-dialer or
                pre-recorded messages to consumers who requested to be contacted either through our App or through an
                Opt-In process on a third-party affiliate’s sources.</p>
            <p>You may remove your information from our database at any time. If you do not wish to receive future
                communications or if you no longer wish to receive our service, go to
                https://forms.storefrontloans.com/unsubscribe.</p>
            <p>Please be aware that your participation in certain activities provided by our App may be limited if
                personally identifiable information is not submitted for the user. E-mail addresses and phone numbers
                received in an opt-out request will be added to our App’s Do-Not-Contact registry within ten (10) days
                after receipt. Unless you “unsubscribe” or opt-out, this App assumes you consent to receiving
                communications from it and its third-party vendors and affiliates. It is possible that a third-party
                vendor or affiliate may have purchased your contact information and thus you may continue to receive
                contacts from those third-parties. The App is not responsible for stopping all unwanted contact from
                sources beyond our immediate control.</p>
            <p>You understand that your consent to receive communications is not required as a condition of using the
                App's services. This App abides by CAN-SPAM and TCPA regarding communications.</p>
            <h3>Minors</h3>
            <p>The App does not knowingly collect information from minors under the age of 18, and does not knowingly
                use such information for any purpose, including marketing purposes. If you are a parent/guardian who
                knows of a minor who has provided our App with personally identifying information, please contact us, so
                that we can delete such information from our database.</p>
