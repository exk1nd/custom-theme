                    <p>If you are one of those <a href="/5-types-people-never-have-money/">people who never have
                            money</a>, then this post is a perfect fit for you. A frugal life is not devoid of fun but
                        is a life featuring wise expenditure. When we think of billionaires, we think of flashy lives
                        characterized by extravagant spending.</p>
                    <p>It does not cross our minds that there are some who are not spendthrift and live a common life
                        unexpected of them. They base their lives on simple virtues and attitudes that guide them and
                        determine their spending habits. Furthermore, these virtues determine frugal billionaires’
                        lifestyles. <span id="more-2742"></span></p>
                    <h2>Economical and Thoughtful Spending</h2>
                    <p>The everyday life of a frugal billionaire is most characterized by thoughtful spending. One
                        reason billionaire got the point they are in their ability to assess opportunities and act on
                        them wisely. Thrifty billionaires evaluate their options before spending money.</p>
                    <p>They make sure that when they are spending they will earn profit in return. The prudent
                        investment puts their money at work for them and makes them even wealthier. Most frugal
                        billionaires’ invest in things like talent, gift or special knowledge because they are concrete
                        assets that they cannot lose easily.</p>
                    <h2>Modest Purchases</h2>
                    <p>Another common habit that you’ll realize in frugal billionaires’ lives is their modest purchases.
                        It’s surprising to fathom but frugal billionaires live in simple homes that cost little than
                        what they can afford and falls below their expected standards. A modest and affordable home
                        enables these wealthy people to free up extra money. The extra money is used to make more money
                        or support other needy projects. For some of them, they don’t see the need to live in
                        million-dollar homes.</p>
                    <h2>Philanthropy</h2>
                    <p>Philanthropy is another notable characteristic of frugal billionaires. With all the money they
                        have, they do not keep it to themselves. Frugal billionaires contribute to projects and support
                        needy causes. They donate clothes to goodwill, food to the hungry and medicine to hospitals
                        without enough supplies. The <a
                                href="https://www.haasjr.org/perspectives/culture-of-philanthropy" target="_blank"
                                rel="noopener">philanthropy culture</a> brings some sense of fulfillment to frugal
                        billionaires.</p>
                    <h2>Credit Avoidance</h2>
                    <p>Credit can be beneficial if used exceptionally well. However, getting used to credit can derail
                        your financial stability. Frugal billionaires use credit less often. In fact, some of them
                        refrain from using credit at all. These groups of wealthy individuals prefer using debit cards
                        to credit cards.</p>
                    <p>Debit cards allow them to spend money that they have compared to credit cards that allow them to
                        make purchases based on debt. Furthermore, using less credit improves their credit scores
                        solidifying their financial stability. But what do average people do? They empty their credit
                        cards and then they look for a <a href="/">loan online</a>.</p>
                    <h2>Reduced Luxury</h2>
                    <img title="luxary things" alt="luxury life" width="300" height="200" src="<?= get_template_directory_uri() . '/assets/img/luxury-300x200.jpg'?>"

                    <figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Photo credit: Pixabay.com</figcaption>
                    <p>Frugal billionaires can spend a thousand dollars every minute and not become bankrupt for the
                        next century or so. However, they do not dwell on luxuries as one may think.</p>
                    <p>Their spending cuts down on luxuries and other expensive stuff. They buy luxuries but to a
                        certain limit. Surprisingly enough, some frugal billionaires like Warren Buffet don’t own a
                        yacht.</p>
                    <p>Instead of buying luxuries, frugal billionaires prefer to invest that extra money and earn more
                        money.</p>
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>A frugal lifestyle comes naturally to most billionaires because of their humble beginnings. One
                        thing that you can borrow from their habits is their way of spending that enables them to
                        balance finances</p>
