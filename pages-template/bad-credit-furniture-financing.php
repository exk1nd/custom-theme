                    </ul>
                    <h3><b>In-Store Financing Furniture with Bad Credit</b></h3>
                    <p>Sometimes the credit history and rating of the borrower is too poor to qualify for any crediting
                        option from finance-related service providers. If your request was rejected, you can try
                        in-store
                        financing.</p>
                    <p>This option is suitable for borrowers with different credit scores. Various stores offer payment
                        plans to help consumers fund their purchases. For instance, FlexShopper, Furniture Mart, and
                        Jack’s
                        Warehouse all offer quick funding on thousands of items from their stores.</p>
                    <p>You may request furniture financing <a href="/bad-credit-loans/">bad credit loan online</a>
                        from
                        these stores and purchase pieces of furniture for every room in your apartment or house. Stores
                        offer flexible requirements for their credit. You don’t need to pay any money upfront although
                        some
                        stores ask for a small deposit.</p>
                    <p>Of course, there are also certain eligibility criteria for potential borrowers. You should have a
                        valid bank account and have a monthly income of at least $1,000 per month. The disadvantage of
                        this
                        option is the high interest rates and extra fees that come with this lending option.</p>
                    <h3><b>Furniture Bad Credit Financing by Credit Cards</b></h3>
                    <p>If you are looking for a quick alternative to the above-mentioned options, using your credit card
                        can
                        also help to fund your urgent needs. Just like a small personal loan, a credit card can be
                        useful
                        for getting quick funds to cover your urgent expenses.</p>
                    <p>The main advantage here is the ability to withdraw cash at the nearest ATM whenever you feel the
                        immediate cash need. Even if your rating and credit history are less-than-perfect you can still
                        apply for this borrowing option.</p>
                    <p>Making on-time payments will help you rebuild your credit rating over time. Pay attention to the
                        rates though as some credit cards can come with higher fees than a regular personal loan.</p>
