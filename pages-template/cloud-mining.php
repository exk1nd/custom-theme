                    bitcoin there are more than 150 crypto-currencies in the world nowadays.</p>
                <p>The &#8220;digital gold&#8221; rate is growing every day. Consumers even get a possibility to get a

                <h2>What is Cloud Mining?</h2>
                <p>Bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency) cloud mining is one of the ways of investment, which is quite
                    successful at the moment. Thanks to the growth of cryptocurrencies, the money invested in it
                    exceeded investments in Apple, Tesla and shares of the mineral companies.</p>
                <p>But, at the moment, not all the cloud services offer cloud bitcoin mining at their expense, giving
                    preference to new cryptocurrencies. However, there are exceptions among such services. For example,
                    Genesis Mining and Hashflare.</p>
                <p>Investing in best cloud mining is the most reasonable step in preserving and increasing your
                    crypto-currency assets.</p>
                <p>In a nutshell, cloud mining simplified mining of bitcoins and altcoins, which relieves you of
                    electricity costs, 24-hour monitoring, software configuration and other complexities connected with
                    the mining on your equipment. Cloud mining is the same earning of bitcoins and altcoins at the
                    expense of computing power, but without using your equipment.</p>
                <p>With bitcoin cash cloud mining, equipment is leased from the services (companies) that have powerful
                    data centers with farms for the production of the cryptocurrency.</p>
                <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Pros of Cloud Mining</strong></span></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>No fan noise and overheating due to CPU operation.</li>
                    <li>Reduction of electricity consumption.</li>
                    <li>There is no need to manage, configure and repair the equipment.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Cons of Cloud Mining</strong></span></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><a href="/what-are-emergency-loans-for-rent/">Rental costs</a> increase the final cost of
                        mining, which affects the final income.</li>
                    <li>Minimal control and lack of choice of a particular server (providers usually distribute tenants
                        for them by themselves).</li>
                    <li>Risk of fraud. Companies in this segment are mostly not transparent, and there are no levers of
                        influence on them.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>How to Choose the Best Cloud Mining Service</h3>
                <p>If you want to <a href="/10-extraordinary-ideas-quick-cash/">increase your income</a> with cloud
                    mining, it is necessary to get as much information as possible about all available providers.</p>
                <p>There are several key criteria that are worth paying attention to them:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Duration of a service</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Reliable companies have been working in this field for many years, have a good reputation among
                    customers and constantly improve their equipment. Such companies are able to guarantee to get a
                    foreseen profit, and, most importantly, transfer it to the user’s wallet.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Percentage of income on the invested amount</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The companies, that promise incredibly high profit, even if you put a minimum deposit, are often
                    scammers. Most likely they do not have any computing power at all and, in fact, sell air. Preference
                    should be given to those services that offer average market rates on cloud profitability.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The types of produced cryptocurrency</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The more types of cryptocurrency are being advertised, the higher the probability that it is not
                    worth trusting. One way or another, each cryptocurrency has its own nuances of working with the
                    mining algorithm and the requirements for equipment. Thus it is very expensive to keep a lot of
                    them.</p>

                    find the most profitable combination.</p>

                    contribution to the total system capacity.</p>
