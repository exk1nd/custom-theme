                <p>Of course, you can. Every borrower today has the right to apply for various lending solutions and choose the most suitable option. You need to be prepared for higher rates and fees, though, as being a low-credit holder means you present higher risks of default.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li aria-level="1"><b>Check Your Score </b>– this is the first thing you need to verify before you even start looking for lending solutions in your area. Many credit reports contain mistakes and you certainly don’t want to have more issues because of such mistakes. Get your free annual credit report from any of the credit reporting bureaus and look through it thoroughly. Sometimes consumers find errors that can be easily eliminated, and it will boost your rating at once.</li>
                    <li aria-level="1"><b>Think Twice</b> – now it’s time to define whether you really need a loan and if you can afford it. Yes, you’ve got it right. Many borrowers can’t afford to take out short term payday loans for bad credit as they often come with astronomical interest rates. When your budget is tight and your income isn’t sufficient to request a certain sum, take some time to evaluate your risks and options. Make sure you take out the sum you can easily repay on time to improve your rating instead of damaging it.</li>
                    <li aria-level="1"><b>Compare Options</b> – now that you understand your current needs and know exactly how much you need to cover unpredicted expenditures, it’s time to shop around for the best terms. It’s important not to rush into the very first service you find. Compare your options and review the conditions at several service providers. Even if your rating is less-than-stellar you have the right to choose the most suitable and affordable lending option.</li>
                    <li aria-level="1"><b>Prequalify </b>– some creditors not brokers may conduct a hard credit inquiry which is harmful to your credit history. Take advantage of prequalification to check whether you can qualify for certain lending options without ruining your score.</li>
                    <li aria-level="1"><b>Find Secured Loans</b> – if you aren’t satisfied with the interest and fees offered by creditors, you can choose a secured lending solution. Short term loans for bad credit same day may come with stellar rates but selecting a secured loan will cost you less over time. Also, <a title="Online Loans for Bad Credit" href="/bad-credit-loans/">bad credit loans</a> can have more flexible terms and repayment schedules.</li>
                    <li aria-level="1"><b>Get a Cosigner</b> – if you know a person who you trust and who trusts you and has a decent credit rating, you can take advantage of that. Having a cosigner allows borrowers to qualify for much more flexible conditions and better rates as the cosigner takes partial responsibility for your debt.</li>
                </ul>
