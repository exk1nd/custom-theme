<p>Many of us have heard about debt management and collections system. But how does it really work? We've covered the topic very briefly already. But now we would like to discuss it a little more.</p>
<h2>Debt Management Plan</h2>
<p>If it's hard for you to make monthly payments on credit bills, a debt management plan can be helpful for you. It's possible to make a single payment to a credit counseling agency. After this, it will do the payments on your behalf.<br />

<p>This plan can't reduce the amount you have to return. However, your credit counselor can make your creditors lower the interest rate or cut down on some fees. Stretching out payments is possible as well. The average duration of a debt management plan is 3-5 years.</p>
<p>A credit counselor will thoroughly research your financial situation and discuss all the available options. You don't have to sign up the very first program it offers you.</p>
<p>For each credit account, included in the plan, you will likely pay enrollment and monthly fees. As a rule, it costs $24 per account.</p>
<p>Secured loans and student loans aren't covered. On the contrary, the unsecured ones are covered. Each month, your counseling agency will get an electronic payment. A progress report will be sent to you each month.</p>
<p>As long as you are in such a program, you have no right to use credit cards. Make timely repayments all the time and meet the creditor's terms.</p>
<h3>What Is Debt Collection?</h3>
<p>Every debt-collection agency specializes in a definite type of borrowing. For instance, an agency can collect loans of more than $200, and not more than 2 years old.</p>
<p>If it is hard for an original creditor to collect a loan, he can sell it to a debt buyer. Such accounts are sold in a group.</p>
<p>The price of debt depends on its type. Buyers keep all the collected debts. They get money for recovering a delinquent account: more recovered debts equals a bigger profit.</p>
<p>Collectors try to convince delinquent borrowers to repay their debts via phone or letters. If they fail, they use software or private investigators. To make the consumers pay, they can also inform the credit bureaus about delinquent payments.</p>
<p>Collectors should count on the debtors to pay. It's not allowed to take a paycheck from a bank account, even if they know the account numbers and the routing. It's possible only after the order of the court.</p>
<p>The collectors have no right to call you before 8 am or after 9 pm. You shouldn't wake up and see the Loan Management and Collections System phone number on your screen.</p>
<p>The reputable collectors neither harass their borrowers nor discriminate them against race, sex, gender or origin. They are fair and law-abiding. If you claim that the loan appeared because of identity theft, they will verify it. They neither report a debt that is older than 7 years nor pursue people who have no money.</p>
<h3>How Does Debt Collection System Work?</h3>
<p>Let us explain you the philosophy of the loan collection system. For instance, Citibank has a network of attorneys all over the country and a definite percentage of cards which are defaulted or go directly to these attorneys that file the lawsuits. The credit bureaus have the program, that can inform the creditors about your capability to pay in case of default.</p>

<p>The loan with the least payment potential is sold cheap. The Citibank is selling debts for 5% of their face value. After this, the junk loan buyers decide who they will sue or sell. Later, they sale some debts to other junk debt buyers. That's how the credit of the buyer suffers 2, 3 or even 4 times more.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, the attorneys of collection industries just filed lawsuits and tried to make cases go to a default judgment. The fact that you get sued does not mean that you are sued by your collector. You are mostly sold by a debt junk buyer. You should know that such cases will not proceed if you tell you have a lawyer and you're contesting this, as it doesn't correspond the legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Tools That Can Improve Profitability</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Сollection Advantage </strong>is a tool that provides you with 24/7 access to information about critical collection: consumer contact data, credit-based scoring, and analytical services.</li>
<li><strong>Eresolve</strong> is an online platform that helps consumers negotiate and pay the accounts past due via the computer, smartphone or tablet. It facilitates payment processing and moderates the conversation between the consumers. It makes the process of collection less stressful.</li>
<li><strong>PowerCurve</strong> <strong>Collections</strong> is a debt management system that includes decisions, data connectivity, self-service capabilities, and workflow. The collections process is focused on the customers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What about Student Loan Debts?</h3>
<p>More and more student loans are going into default. When it happens, the student loan servicer transfers them to a third-party collection company.</p>
<p>If you default on your student loans, talk to a collecting agency assigned to your loan. They will consult you on settling the repayment terms, loan rehabilitation, or even settling the debt.</p>
<p>Debt Management and Collections System U.S. Department of Education aims at helping to repay federal student loans. It can help you repay the existing loan. However, after this, you can get new fees. So ask about all the terms beforehand.</p>
<p>In case you have to deal with a student loan calculator, you should use a new portal to have access to your loans.</p>
<p>There are more than 30 various student loan collection agencies. Take it seriously in case one of them contacts you.  Remember that you are protected by the law and such companies have no right to harass you or disturb you during the sleeping hours.</p>
