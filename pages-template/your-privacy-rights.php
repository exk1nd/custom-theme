        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the https://paydaysay.com/ website (“Website”, “Site”) as well as the
            Payday Advance - Borrow Money app (“App”) as a part of the Website. It explains the services the Site/App provides, tells about
            the information collected by the Site.</p>
        <h3>Disclosure</h3>
        <p>The operator of the PaydaySay website and/or app is neither a lender nor a broker. PaydaySay doesn’t make any
            credit or finance-related decisions but offers the users a loan-connecting service. PaydaySay securely
            transfers the information the users provide to the third-party lenders that determine the APR, fees, and all
            the other loan terms.</p>
        <h3>The Information PaydaySay Collects</h3>
        <p>PaydaySay collects both personally identifiable information that may identify a certain individual and
            non-personally identifiable information that identifies anonymous data that cannot be associated with a
            particular individual.</p>
        <p>Personally identifiable information is collected when the users complete the online application form to
            request a loan from a lender participating in the network or when they send questions to the Website/App.
            This includes name, address, phone number, SSN, email, birth date, driver’s license number, citizenship
            status, employment details, amount and frequency of paychecks, information about home ownership, and your
            banking account.</p>
        <p>Non-personally identifiable information is collected either through the use of third-party tracking systems
            or directly through the use of ‘cookies’. This includes the user’s IP address, the browser type, access
            time, language, information about the links the user follows, and the areas of the Site the user visits.</p>
        <p>Cookies are pieces of information a website sends to the user’s computer while the user is viewing a site to
            remember the user without personal identification.</p>
        <p>PaydaySay can share non-personally identifiable information with its suppliers and other third parties for
            the purpose of statistical and trend analysis.</p>
        <p>Third parties, like lenders and advertising partners, may be allowed to display advertisements on the
            Site/App. These third parties can use cookies or other technologies to track and collect the information on
            the users interacting with their advertisements. PaydaySay doesn’t provide PII to these third parties.</p>
        <h3>How PaydaySay Uses Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
        <p>The PPI can be collected by PaydaySay to provide the requested service. The details the user provides in the
            application form are transferred to the partner lenders participating in the network. The information may be
            used to resolve disputes, address technical problems, or enforce agreements. The use of PII is limited to
            what is deemed necessary for providing the service.</p>
        <p>By submitting the personally identifiable information, the users consent that it can be shared with reliable
            third parties (in accordance with the applicable law), including the direct providers of financial options
            PaydaySay affiliated with. The information can be used for marketing services and advertising that may be
            defined as interesting to the user. PaydaySay reserves the right to share, sell, or otherwise disclose the
            users’ information to third parties.</p>
        <p>The operator of the PaydaySay Website/App doesn’t have any access to the information the users provide in the
            application form. The loan requests the users submit are securely transferred to the trusted direct lenders
            participating in the web network.</p>
        <p>Providing the PII, the users permit the partner lenders to contact them regarding the loan request and
            processing. Thus, applicants waive the right to file any claims related to these contacts to the FTC or any
            other agency.</p>
        <h3>Sharing Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
        <p>The service offered by PaydaySay is provided by the third parties. PaydaySay can share your information with
            these third parties to provide better service. PaydaySay may also share personal information with the
            participating lenders, affiliates, and assignees whenever it is deemed necessary.</p>
        <p>The third parties have their own privacy policies describing the way they use and/or disclose personal
            information.</p>
        <p>PaydaySay discloses the PII in response to a court order, subpoena or similar investigative demand, request
            for cooperation from a law enforcement agency or other government agency; to establish or exercise the legal
            rights; to defend against legal claims, or as otherwise required by law. The PII may be also disclosed when
            it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud, or
            other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of the parent company, its
            employees, its website users, or others; or to enforce the <a
                    href="/terms-and-conditions/">Terms and Conditions</a> or other agreements
            or policies.</p>
        <h3>Opt-Out</h3>
        <p>When the users provide PII, they automatically opt-in. If the users get contacted by third parties, they have
            the right to opt-out of any further communications.</p>
        <h3>Links to Other Websites</h3>
        <p>PaydaySay can link or automatically redirect the users to the third-party sites that don’t operate under this
            Privacy Policy. It is advised to review the terms of use as well as the privacy policies of the websites you
            are taken to, as PaydaySay doesn’t control or operate them.</p>
        <h3>Changes</h3>
        <p>The PaydaySay policies, content, information, promotions, disclosures, disclaimers, and features may be
            revised, modified, updated, and/or supplemented at any time and without prior notice at its sole and
            absolute discretion.</p>

            and/or disclosure. When the data is sent to the lenders over the Internet, it is protected by the Secure
